or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars (the Working Capital Facility ), in each case to be used in connection with our construction of and production
at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Fixed Asset Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the
market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.7625%, and (ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus
1.3%. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Working Capital Facility incurred interest at a rate equal to the market quoted interest rate published by the
People’s Bank of China minus 0.4525 %. The Fixed Asset Facility is secured by certain real property relating to Gigafactory Shanghai and both facilities are
non-recourse to our other assets. In December 2020, the Working Capital Facility matured.

In May 2020, one of our subsidiaries entered into an additional Working Capital Loan Contract (the “2020 China Working Capital Facility”) with a lender
in China for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 4.00 billion (or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars), to be used for expenditures related to
production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Borrowed funds bear interest at an annual rate of: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market quoted interest rate
published by an authority designated by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.35%, (ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus
0.8%. The 2020 China Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to our assets and is scheduled to mature in June 2021, the first anniversary of the first
borrowing under the loan.

**Cash Equity Debt**

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears
interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

**Solar Loan-backed Notes**

In January 2016 and January 2017, our subsidiaries pooled and transferred certain MyPower customer notes receivable into two SPEs and issued
$330 million in aggregate principal amount of Solar Loan-backed Notes, backed by these notes receivable to investors. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain
or loss on the transfer of these notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The payments received by
the SPEs from these notes receivable are used to service the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the Solar Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’
expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs,
including the Solar Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

**Warehouse Agreements**

In August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (as amended from time to time, the “2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for
borrowings secured by the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On August 17, 2017, the 2016 Warehouse
Agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the maturity date, and our subsidiaries entered into another loan
and security agreement (the “2017 Warehouse Agreement”) with substantially the same terms as and that shared the same committed amount with the 2016
Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend the availability periods
thereunder from August 17, 2018 to August 16, 2019 and extend the maturity dates from September 2019 to September 2020. On December 28, 2018, our
subsidiaries terminated the 2017 Warehouse Agreement after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, and entered into a third loan and security
agreement with substantially the same terms as and that shared the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement (the “2018 Warehouse
Agreement”). We refer to these agreements together as the “Warehouse Agreements”. Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreements generally bear or
bore interest at a fixed margin above (i) LIBOR or (ii) the commercial paper rate. The Warehouse Agreements are or were non-recourse to our other assets.

In August 2020, one of our subsidiaries terminated the 2018 Warehouse Agreement after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, leaving the 2016
Warehouse Agreement as the only remaining Warehouse Agreement. In August 2020, we further amended and restated the 2016 Warehouse Agreement to
extend the maturity date to September 2022. The 2016 Warehouse Agreement currently has an aggregate lender commitment of $1.10 billion, the same amount
as the aggregate lender commitment previously shared with the 2018 Warehouse Agreement prior to the termination of the latter.

Pursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased
vehicles has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising
from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the
Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not required to pay obligations under the Warehouse Agreements are or were available for distributions.
