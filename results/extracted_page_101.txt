position, and brand.

**Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns**

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from
reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged
from a co-sited solar power facility (“ITC”s). Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems
as assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for purposes of claiming ITCs. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when
applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any audits
undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not
probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the
solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for
purposes of claiming ITCs. We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair
values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through
to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine exactly how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs, we are unable to
reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be
claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state’s
incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are
allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund
investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

**Letters of Credit**


As of December 31, 2020, we had $233 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.


**Note 17 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements**

We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In
particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related
agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the
power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and
make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be
sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the
fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.

As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these
VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of
income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are
allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.

Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the
formula specified in the agreements.

Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.

Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as
operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund
investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had
been pledged as collateral for their obligations.
