as shall be designated by such Lender in a written notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and
communications shall, when mailed, emailed, telecopied, or sent by overnight courier, be effective when received.

(b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic
communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices
pursuant to Section 2 unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Company and each of the other Credit Parties may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder
by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to
particular notices or communications.

13.04. Foreign Taxes.

(a) All amounts (including costs and expenses) expressed to be payable under a Credit Document by any Credit Party to a
Lender or the Administrative Agent which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for Foreign Tax purposes are
deemed to be exclusive of any Foreign Tax which is chargeable on that supply. If Foreign Tax is or becomes chargeable on any supply by
any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Credit Party under a Credit Document and such Lender or Administrative Agent is required
to account to the relevant tax authority for the Foreign Tax, that Credit Party must pay to such Lender or Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, (in addition to any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the Foreign Tax upon receipt by
the Credit Party of a valid Foreign Tax invoice.

(b) If Foreign Tax is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender or the Administrative Agent (the
“Supplier”) to any other Lender or the Administrative Agent (the “Recipient”) under a Credit Document, and any party other than the

supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the Person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the Foreign Tax) the
Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the
amount of the Foreign Tax; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the Person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the Foreign Tax) the
Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the Foreign Tax
chargeable on that supply.

(c) Where a Credit Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender or the Administrative Agent for any
cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Lender or Administrative Agent for the full amount of
such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents Foreign Tax, save to the extent that such Lender or Administrative Agent
reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such Foreign Tax from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this Section 13.04 to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a member of a group
