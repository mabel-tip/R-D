**Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities**

In December 2016, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “Canada Credit Facility”) with a bank for borrowings secured by our
interests in certain vehicle leases. In December 2017 and December 2018, the Canada Credit Facility was amended to add our interests in additional vehicle
leases as collateral, allowing us to draw additional funds. Amounts drawn under the Canada Credit Facility bear interest at fixed rates. The Canada Credit
Facility is non-recourse to our other assets.

In September 2020, an SPE entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank for borrowings secured by the beneficial interests related to certain
leased vehicles that we transferred to the SPE. Amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at 1.85% plus LIBOR and are non-recourse to our other assets.

We have entered into various solar revolving credit facility and other loan agreements with various financial institutions. The solar revolving credit
