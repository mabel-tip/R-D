interest we capitalized from the consolidated statements of operations to property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Increased
capitalization results in lower interest expense. The amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance, which increased yearover-year due to our construction and expansion of multiple factories.

Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and
liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon
movements in the underlying exchange rates.

Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $167 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019. The unfavorable change was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the U.S. dollar depreciating greater than 5%
against the euro and the Chinese yuan in 2020 compared to an appreciation of 2% and 1% against the same currencies in the prior year, respectively.

Our effective tax rate increased from -17% to 25% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to substantial pretax income in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.
