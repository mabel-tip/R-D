**We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory,**
**political, economic, tax and labor conditions.**

We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions,
over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S.,
create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local
operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations
and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and
preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and
require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we unable to manage them effectively.

**Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become**
**fully functional.**

If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of our
vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation,
our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability,
breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. In particular, our products are highly dependent on software,
which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those
related to the Model S and Model X 17-inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S, the seats and doors in the Model X and
the operation of solar panels installed by us. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such
efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing on our
products and features, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance
characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.

**We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.**

The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles
do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future
will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot or FSD features are engaged are the subject of significant
public attention. We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies
that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the
energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our
battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing
failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and
energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may
subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of
which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability
claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.

**We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.**

In order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings
agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited
operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing,
delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our
quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular,
Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are well-publicized by a range of third parties. Such attention includes frequent
criticism, which is often exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative
perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.
