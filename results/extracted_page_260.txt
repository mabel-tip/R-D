Commitment) and the Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to any Letter of Credit Fee; and

(v) if any Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant
to this Section 2.15(a), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all
Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 4.01(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure shall be
payable to the applicable Issuing Lender until such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated.

Defaulting Lender (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Lender shall be required to
issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Loan
Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral has been provided by the applicable Borrowers in accordance with
Section 2.15(a), and (ii) participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall
