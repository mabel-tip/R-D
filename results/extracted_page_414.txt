(e) All payments required to be made hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Secured Creditors.

(f) For purposes of applying payments received in accordance with this Clause 17 (Application of Proceeds), the
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Administrative Agent for a determination (which the
Administrative Agent agrees to provide upon request of the Collateral Agent) of the outstanding Primary
Obligations and Secondary Obligations owed to the Secured Creditors. Unless it has received written notice from a
Secured Creditor to the contrary, the Administrative Agent, in furnishing information pursuant to the preceding
sentence, and the Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to assume that no Secondary Obligations
are outstanding.

(g) It is understood that the Chargors shall remain jointly and severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between
the amount of the proceeds of the Security Assets and the aggregate amount of the Obligations.

(h) It is understood and agreed by each Chargor and each Secured Creditor that the Collateral Agent shall have no
liability for any determinations made by it in this Section 16.1 (Application), in each case except to the extent
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Each Chargor and each Secured Creditor also
agrees that the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be required to), at any time and in its sole discretion, and with
no liability resulting therefrom, petition a court of competent jurisdiction regarding any application of the Security
Assets in accordance with the requirements hereof, and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to wait for, and may
conclusively rely on, any such determination.

**17.2** **Contingencies**

If the Security created by or pursuant to this Deed is enforced at a time when no amounts are due under the Credit Documents (but at a
time when amounts may become so due), the Collateral Agent or a Receiver may pay the proceeds of any recoveries effected by it into a
blocked suspense account (bearing interest at such rate (if any) as the Collateral Agent usually grants for accounts of that size and nature).

**17.3** **Appropriation and suspense account**

(a) Subject to Clause 17.1 (Application), the Collateral Agent shall apply all payments received in respect of the
Secured Obligations in reduction of any part of the Secured Obligations in any order or manner which it may
determine.

(b) Any such appropriation shall override any appropriation by any Chargor.

(c) All monies received, recovered or realised by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with this Deed may at the
discretion of the Collateral Agent be credited to a separate interest bearing suspense account (with interest
accruing thereon at at least the rate that the Collateral Agent usually grants for accounts of that size and nature)
for so long as the Collateral Agent determines without the Collateral Agent having any
