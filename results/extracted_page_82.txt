note hedge transactions was $398 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of
our common stock at a price of $112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. We received $257 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of
these warrants. Taken together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges and the sales of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or
cash payments from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion from $71.97 to $112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect
to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and
are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction
to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2021 Notes on at
least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2021 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes is in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common
stock for any conversion premium at our election, we reclassified $3 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes and
the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The debt
discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense through March 2021 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such
recognition through December 31, 2020, including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $958 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes were converted for $958 million in cash and
11.1 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $6
million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the
notes, resulting in the receipt of 11.1 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle under
their terms after the maturity or settlement of the related convertible debt. The remaining notes outstanding are expected to convert in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the 2021 Notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $3.71 billion.

**2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions**

In March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after
deducting transaction costs, were $966 million.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at
their option, on or after December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the
following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or
not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2)
during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the
product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we
make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, the 2022 Notes will be settled in
cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022
Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued
and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to
convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022
Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an
effective interest rate of 6.00%.
