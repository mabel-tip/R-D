Availability to be less than 10% of Availability at such time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.01(b), the Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline
Loan after it has received written notice from any Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an
Event of Default exists and is continuing until such time as the Swingline Lender shall have received written notice (A) of rescission of all
such notices from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or notices or (B) of the waiver of such Default or Event of Default
by the Required Lenders.

(c) On any Business Day, the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may, in its sole discretion
give notice to the Lenders that the Swingline Lender’s outstanding Swingline Loans or the Administrative Agent’s outstanding Agent
Advances, as the case may be, shall be funded with one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans to be made to, and maintained by, the
relevant Borrower of the outstanding Swingline Loan or Agent Advance being funded by such Revolving Loan in U.S. Dollars (provided
that such notice shall be deemed to have been given no later than the fifth Business Day after the making of any Swingline Loan (if not
given earlier) and shall be deemed to have been automatically given upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section
11.05 or upon the exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section 11), in which case one or more Borrowings of
Revolving Loans in U.S. Dollars constituting Base Rate Loans (any such Borrowing, a “Mandatory Borrowing”) shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all Lenders pro rata based on each such Lender’s RL Percentage (determined before giving effect
to any termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 11) and the proceeds thereof shall be
applied directly by the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to repay the Swingline Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for such outstanding Swingline Loans or Agent Advances. Each Lender hereby irrevocably
agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one Business Day’s notice pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner
specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing by the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case
may be, notwithstanding (i) the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the Minimum Borrowing Amount otherwise
required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 7 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then
exists, (iv) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, and (v) the amount of any Borrowing Base or the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at
such time and (vi) during a Reduced Availability Period, Excess Availability after giving effect to such Loans. In the event that any
Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including as a result of the commencement of
a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to any Borrower (including under any Dutch Insolvency Law)), then each Lender
hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for
any payments received from any Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the Swingline Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, such participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans or Agent Advances, as the case may be,
as shall be necessary to cause the Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans or Agent Advances, as the case may be, ratably based upon
their respective RL Percentages (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the
last paragraph of Section 11), provided that (x) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans or Agent Advances, as the case may be, shall
be for the account of the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, until the date as of which the respective
participation is required to be purchased and, to the extent attributable to the purchased participation, shall be payable to the participant
from and after such date and (y) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this
