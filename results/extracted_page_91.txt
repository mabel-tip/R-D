**ESPP**

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. During
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 1.8 million, 2.5 million and 2.0 million shares under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect to the
Stock Split. There were 34.3 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2020.

**Fair Value Assumptions**

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock
option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2020** **2019** **2018**
Risk-free interest rate 0.26% 2.4% 2.5%
Expected term (in years) 3.9 4.5 4.7
Expected volatility 69% 48% 42%
Dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
Grant date fair value per share (1) $ 216.14 $ 22.32 $ 24.38

(1) Prior period results have been adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. See Note 1, Overview, for details.

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our
common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grantâ€™s
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.
