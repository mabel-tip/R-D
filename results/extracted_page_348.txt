(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder including
to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior notification to
the Administrative Agent, any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Loans and Notes to its trustee or to a collateral
agent providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations to such trustee, such collateral agent or a holder of
such obligations, as the case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder.

(d) Any Lender which assigns all of its Revolving Loan Commitment and/or Loans hereunder in accordance with Section
13.0413.05(b) shall cease to constitute a “Lender” hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement
(including Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.06, 5.04, 12.06, 13.01 and 13.0613.07), which shall survive as to such assigning Lender solely with
respect to events or circumstances that occurred prior to such assignment.

(e) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Credit Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or
other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.

(f) A transfer or assignment under Section 13.0413.05(b) may, with respect to a Dutch Borrower, only be made to a person
who is a Professional Lender.

13.0513.06. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no
course of dealing between the Company, any other Borrower or any other Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
any Issuing Lender or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender
or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
