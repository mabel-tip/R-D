13.1013.11. Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective on the date (the “Effective Date”) on which (i) the
Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company that are other Borrowers on the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
and each of the Lenders shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered the
same to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office or, in the case of the Lenders, shall have given to the Administrative Agent
telephonic (confirmed in writing), written notice (actually received) at such office that the same has been signed and mailed to it and (ii)
the conditions contained in Section 6 have been met to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative
Agent has received actual notice from any Lender that the conditions described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence have not been met
to its satisfaction, upon the satisfaction of the condition described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence and upon the
Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that the conditions described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence have
been met, then the Effective Date shall have deemed to have occurred, regardless of any subsequent determination that one or more of
the conditions thereto had not been met (although the occurrence of the Effective Date shall not release any Borrower from any liability
for failure to satisfy one or more of the applicable conditions contained in Section 6, other than any condition that must be satisfied to the
Administrative Agent’s satisfaction or other subjective standard of similar effect). The Administrative Agent will give the Company, the
other Borrowers and each Lender prompt written notice of the occurrence of the Effective Date.
