**Our Products and Services**

**Automotive**

**Model 3**

Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal, which we began delivering in
July 2017. We currently manufacture Model 3 at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai.

**Model Y**

Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults, which we began delivering in March
2020. We currently manufacture Model Y at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai.

**Model S and Model X**

Model S is a four-door full-size sedan that we began delivering in June 2012. Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults, which we
began delivering in September 2015. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and
SUV, respectively, and we manufacture both models at the Fremont Factory.

**Future Consumer and Commercial Electric Vehicles**

We have also announced several planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, including specialized consumer electric vehicles in
Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster and a commercial electric vehicle in Tesla Semi. We also plan to introduce in the future a lower-cost vehicle to leverage
developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”), battery cell and other technologies.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

**Energy Storage Products**

We began deliveries of the most recent generations of Powerwall, Powerpack and Megapack, which are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products
integrated with inverters and control technology, in 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Powerwall is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial
facility. Megapack and Powerpack are energy storage solutions for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, which may be grouped
together to form larger installations capable of reaching gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater. We also offer integrated systems combining energy generation and
storage. Our energy storage products are currently assembled at Gigafactory Nevada.
