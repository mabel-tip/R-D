**Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.**

We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics or other events outside of our control. For example, our corporate headquarters, the
Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located
in a flood-prone area. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down
or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our
products. In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer
behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. We may
incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

**Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations**

**Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development**
**and adoption of such products.**

Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax
exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated or exhausted from time to time. For example, a $7,500 federal tax credit that was available in
the U.S. for the purchase of our vehicles was reduced in phases during and ultimately ended in 2019. We believe that this sequential phase-out likely pulled
forward some vehicle demand into the periods preceding each reduction. Moreover, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including
Ontario, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Denmark and California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not
eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. Any similar developments could have some negative impact on demand for our
vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them.

In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy
storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.
However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes
without warning. For example, the U.S. federal government currently offers certain tax credits for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage
systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility; however, these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond.
Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems
generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced,
altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the FERC. Any reductions or terminations of
such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for potential customers,
increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy
storage assets.

Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair
market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have
determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our
obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.

**We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our**
**operations or products.**

As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety
laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling,
storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to
constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. The costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues and any changes to our
operations mandated by new or amended laws, may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. We are also
subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale and service of automobiles both domestically and abroad. For example, in
countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and
