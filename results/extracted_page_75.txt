Goodwill 79
Total purchase price $ 207

Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected
synergies from integrating Maxwell’s technology into our automotive segment as well as the acquired talent. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax
purposes and is not amortized.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired

The determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives were as follows (in millions, except for estimated
useful life):


**Useful Life**


**Fair Value** **(in years)**

Developed technology $ 102 9
Customer relations 2 9
Trade name 1 10
Total intangible assets $ 105

Maxwell’s results of operations since the Acquisition Date have been included within the automotive segment. Standalone and pro forma results of
operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements.

**Other 2019 Acquisitions**

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed various other acquisitions generally for the related technology and workforce. Total
consideration for these acquisitions was $96 million, of which $80 million was paid in cash. In aggregate, $36 million was attributed to intangible assets, $51
million was attributed to goodwill within the automotive segment, and $9 million was attributed to net assets assumed. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S.
income tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were related to purchased technology, with estimated useful lives of one to nine years.

Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements, either
individually or in aggregate.

**Note 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets**

Goodwill increased $9 million within the automotive segment from $198 million as of December 31, 2019 to $207 million as of December 31, 2020 due to
completed business combinations and foreign currency translation adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no accumulated
impairment losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
