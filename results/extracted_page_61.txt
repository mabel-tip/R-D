through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing
partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their
vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a predetermined resale value.

With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the
Automotive Leasing section below, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right
of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception.
The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of
recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our
estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus
consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to
determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our
vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings
during 2020, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. As
a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we
adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $72
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned
vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net impact was $30
million reduction in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options
program was $703 million and $639 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of which $202 million and $93 million was short
term, respectively.

Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates on
automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in millions):


**Year ended December 31,**


**2020** **2019**
Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without
resale value guarantee— beginning of period $ 1,472 $ 883
Additions 724 880
Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts 56 9
Revenue recognized (326) (300)
Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without
resale value guarantee— end of period $ 1,926 $ 1,472

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of
December 31, 2020. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019, revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was
$283 million. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $220 million. Of
the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of December 31, 2020, we expect to recognize $1.13 billion of
revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale
Value Guarantee.
