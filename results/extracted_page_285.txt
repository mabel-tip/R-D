claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by
applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed,
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or
the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements
of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) as may be necessary
for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that
such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and
withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

Treaty Lender without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes imposed by the United Kingdom. A Treaty
Lender which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this
Agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in writing and, having done so, that
Treaty Lender shall be under no further obligation pursuant to this Section 5.04(e)(iii).

(iv) Each Lender listed on Schedule 1.01(a) (each, an “Original Lender”) confirms and represents that it is (x) a
Qualifying Lender other than a Treaty Lender or (y) holds a passport under HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme (a “DTTP
Passport”) and that its scheme reference number is set out against its name in Schedule 1.01(a).

(v) Any Lender which is not an Original Lender shall confirm to the Borrowers as soon as possible after
becoming a Lender whether it is (a) a Treaty Lender, (b) a Qualifying Lender other than a Treaty Lender or (c) is not a
Qualifying Lender (“Tax Confirmation”) and in the case of a Treaty Lender, it shall also confirm whether or not it holds a DTTP
Passport and, if so, provide the scheme reference number.
