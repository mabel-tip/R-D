**Solar Energy Offerings**

We sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through lease and power purchase agreement
(“PPA”) arrangements and a subscription-based sale of solar power, which is currently available in limited U.S. markets. We purchase most of the components
for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain
components for our solar energy products.

In 2019, we commenced direct customer and channel partner sales of the third generation of our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles
with energy generation. We are ramping the volume production of Solar Roof at Gigafactory New York, and we are improving our installation capability and
efficiency.

**Technology**

**Automotive**

**Battery and Powertrain**

Our core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique
advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while
withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and
performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, and are introducing vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased
performance.

Among other things, we maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of
knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy
density at lower costs, we are currently using our expertise to develop a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.

**Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software**

The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles
optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including
most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.

**Self-Driving Development**

We have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision and radar-based sensors. Our
FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of
field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.

Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at present the driver is
ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and
potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve
these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.

We intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even
as modes of transportation evolve.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

**Energy Storage Products**

We leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of
battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity among our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables us to
interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also
developed the software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems using our real-time energy trading platform.
