We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially
more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic for these cells. However, we have to date fully
qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our
suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells
manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our
efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required and may require significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy
storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.

In addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials
such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market
conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any
reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the
increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.

**We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.**

The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model
Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A
significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered or are reported to have plans to
enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving
technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such
as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have
significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support
of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market
share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of
competing energy systems, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy
sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases
and PPAs.

**Risks Related to Our Operations**

**We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada, which may harm the**
**production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.**

Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production by
our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing high-quality cells at significant volume at its factories in
Japan, it has relatively limited experience with cell production at Gigafactory Nevada, which began in 2017. Moreover, although Panasonic is co-located with us
at Gigafactory Nevada, it is free to make its own operational decisions, such as its determination to temporarily suspend its manufacturing there in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs incorporating the cells produced by Panasonic
for Model 3 and Model Y and drive units (including to support Gigafactory Shanghai production), at Gigafactory Nevada, and we also manufacture energy
storage products there. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity,
and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we or Panasonic are unable to or
otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain
highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.

Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various
facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While
