December 31, 2020, maturities of our operating lease and sales type lease receivables from customers for each of the next five years and thereafter were as
follows (in millions):

**Operating** **Sales-type**

**Leases** **Leases**
2021 $ 774 $ 21
2022 594 21
2023 351 21
2024 206 30
2025 191 5
Thereafter 2,102 4
Gross lease receivables $ 4,218 $ 102

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received
upfront. For our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined
rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a function of the power
generated by the related solar energy systems in the future.

**Net Investment in Sales-type Leases**

Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of the future contractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated
balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as other assets for the long-term portion. We introduced
sales-type leasing programs in volume during the third quarter of 2020 and therefore have no associated balances as of December 31, 2019. Lease receivables
relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in millions):

**December 31,**
**2020**
Gross lease receivables $ 102
Unearned interest income (11)
Net investment in sales-type leases $ 91

**Reported as:**
Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 17
Other assets 74
Net investment in sales-type leases $ 91

**Note 14 – Equity Incentive Plans**

In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019
Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock
options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are
exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2020, 49.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.
