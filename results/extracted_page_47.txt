leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing facilities and certain corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business
practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services
and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in
millions):

**Year Ended December 31,**
**Total** **2021** **2022** **2023** **2024** **2025** **Thereafter**
Operating lease obligations,
including imputed interest $ 1,846 $ 366 $ 327 $ 279 $ 245 $ 204 $ 425
Finance lease obligations,
including imputed interest 1,635 462 446 412 299 9 7
Purchase obligations (1) 18,318 10,483 2,743 2,280 1,877 865 70
Debt, including scheduled
interest (2) 11,695 2,100 2,172 2,602 2,021 2,109 691
Total $ 33,494 $ 13,411 $ 5,688 $ 5,573 $ 4,442 $ 3,187 $ 1,193

(1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $5.95 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31,
2020 and (ii) $12.37 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells
produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum
purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2020, we
have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date or, where
applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts
were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts
payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020.

(2) This includes non-recourse debt repayments, including scheduled interest, of $5.16 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only
assets of our subsidiaries. Short-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and
deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $342 million. Long-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible
senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the years thereafter is $1.13 billion.

The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $353 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets.

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified
commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners (refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option in Note 2, Significant
Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The maximum amount we could be
required to pay under these programs, should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options, would be $1.84 billion over the next five
years, of which $394 million is within a 12-month period from December 31, 2020. We have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many
customers will exercise their options. Additionally, we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore, the actual exposure to us is deemed to
be limited.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as
structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes.
