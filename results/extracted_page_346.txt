13.0413.05. Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, neither the Company
nor any other Borrower may assign or transfer any of their rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Lenders except as permitted by Section 10.02 and except for any assignment from any Dutch Borrower to the Company expressly
contemplated by Section 2.10(ef) or from any UK Borrower to the Company expressly contemplated by Section 2.10(g) and, provided
further, that, although any Lender may grant participations to Eligible Transferees in its rights hereunder, such Lender shall remain a
“Lender” for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any portion of its Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder
except as provided in Sections 2.13 and 13.0413.05(b)) and the participant shall not constitute a “Lender” hereunder and, provided
further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment
to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final
scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond the Final Maturity Date or is
otherwise cash collateralized in accordance with the terms hereof) in which such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend
the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest
rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this
Agreement, to Section 13.07(a) or as contemplated in clause (6) of the second proviso of Section 13.1213.13(a) shall not constitute a
reduction in the rate of interest or Fees payable hereunder), or increase the amount of the participant’s participation over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total
Revolving Loan Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any Revolving Loan
Commitment (or the available portion thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant’s
participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under any or all of the Security Documents (except
as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) or all or substantially all of the value of the Guaranty (except as expressly provided in the
Credit Documents) supporting the Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder in which such participant is participating. The Borrowers agree
that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 3.06, 2.11 and 5.04 (subject to the requirements and limitations
therein, including the requirements under Section 5.04(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.04(e)
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.12(b) and
2.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Sections 2.10, 3.06 or 5.04, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.13 with respect to any Participant.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all
or a portion of its Revolving Loan Commitment and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Revolving Loan Commitment has
terminated, outstanding Obligations) hereunder to (i) (A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50%
owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B) to one or more other Lenders or any affiliate of any such other
