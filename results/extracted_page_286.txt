(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any
Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to Section 5.04(a), it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund),
net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof with respect to such refund), provided that
the U.S. Borrowers (on a joint and several basis) and the Dutch Borrowers (on a joint and several basis) and the UK Borrowers (on a joint
and several basis), as the case may be, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over
to any such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant jurisdiction or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to
repay such refund to such jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof; provided, further, that no Borrower shall be
required to repay the Administrative Agent or such Lender an amount in excess of the amount paid over by such party to any such
Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.04(f). This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Company, any other
Borrower, any other Credit Party or any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.04(f), in no event will
the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.04(f) the payment of which would
place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Indemnified Tax
subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification
payments or additional amounts with respect to such Indemnified Tax had never been paid.
