operating results.

**We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks,**
**or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.**

Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We also frequently adjust our retail operations and product offerings
in order to optimize our reach, costs, product line-up and model differentiation and customer experience. However, there is no guarantee that such steps will be
accepted by consumers accustomed to traditional sales strategies. For example, marketing methods such as touchless test drives that we have pioneered in
certain markets have not been proven at scale. We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential
customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants
at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries
matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we
develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.

Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. While we have improved
our delivery logistics, we may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. For
example, we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in China and Europe to initially deliver Model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019. We have
deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such
models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp Solar Roof, we are working to substantially increase installation personnel and decrease
installation times. If we are not successful in matching such capabilities with actual production, or if we experience unforeseen production delays or inaccurately
forecast demand for the Solar Roof, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals.
If we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our
vehicles, particularly higher-volume and newer additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts
inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and
connectors throughout the world.

There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally,
that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will
meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate
additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we
expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our
products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may
harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

**Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive**
**industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.**

If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if
demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results
may be harmed.

We are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine
vehicles. In addition, electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively
affected by numerous factors, such as:

   - perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;

   - perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;

   - competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion
engine vehicles;

   - volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020;
