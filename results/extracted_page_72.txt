storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to
date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales,
and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does
not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or
PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next
12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive
business, accrued warranty balance was primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):

**Year Ended December 31,**

**2020** **2019** **2018**
Accrued warranty—beginning of period $ 1,089 $ 748 $ 402
Warranty costs incurred (312) (250) (209)
Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties,
including expirations and foreign exchange impact 66 36 (26)
Additional warranty accrued from adoption of ASC 606 — — 37
Provision for warranty 625 555 544
Accrued warranty—end of period $ 1,468 $ 1,089 $ 748

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”) when they are purchased by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar
energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental
costs incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is
transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue.

Nevada Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that
provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195.0 million in consideration of capital
investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the incentive. As
of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had earned the maximum of $195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would
receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School
District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting
certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. As of December 31, 2020, we had not yet
received any grant funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County.
