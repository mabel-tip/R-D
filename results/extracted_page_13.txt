known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

**Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business**

**We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.**

Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors
have limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of
such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce, including in parts of the U.S. and
a number of areas in Europe.

We temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020. Some of our suppliers and
partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory
Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Reduced operations or
closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors have resulted in challenges in or postponements
for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales and energy product deployments. Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact
us and our industries. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in
additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply, and it
is yet unknown how we may be impacted. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable
and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the
construction of and ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges.

We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends, the sustained impact of which is largely unknown, is rapidly evolving and has varied
across geographic regions. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as
appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources
accordingly. If current global market conditions continue or worsen, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such
conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be
harmed.

**We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our**
**manufacturing costs.**

We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we
encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the ramp of Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full
automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and
design features for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.

In particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y, which we
are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide. We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y at high
volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies. In order to be successful, we
will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design
tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China and Germany. We will also need to
hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past
may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we
are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our
related cost and profitability targets.

We may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product
versions or variants; new vehicles such as Tesla Semi, Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster; and future features and services such as new Autopilot or FSD
features and the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals
necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.
