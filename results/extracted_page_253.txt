constitute, a Base Rate Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars on such day or (2) if such LIBOR Loan is denominated in any Available
Currency (other than U.S. Dollars), then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the

prepaid by such Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this
subclause (B)) shall constitute, a Base Rate Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars (in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Equivalent
of such Available Currency) on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the applicable Borrower does not so prepay
such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, local time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such
LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars), and, in the case of such subclause (B), upon any subsequent

Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), (ii) in respect of a LIBOR Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars where the affected
LIBOR Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected
Lender to convert such LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan; provided that, if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected
Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 2.10(bc) or (iii) in respect of a LIBOR Loan denominated in Euros or an
Acceptable Foreign Currency, repay such Loan upon the expiration of the then-applicable Interest Period (or such earlier period as

governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy
