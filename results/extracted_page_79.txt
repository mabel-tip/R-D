the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We
account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment
classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the
consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed
using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $1.77 billion and $1.73 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in
relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.

In 2019, the Shanghai government agreed to provide $85 million of certain incentives in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment
investments at Gigafactory Shanghai, of which $46 million was received in cash and the remaining $39 million was in the form of assets and services
contributed by the government. In 2020, the Shanghai government agreed to provide an additional $122 million of such incentives. Of the total incentives
provided between both years, $123 million was received in cash in 2020. Proceeds from the grant must be spent on qualified capital investments at Gigafactory
Shanghai as stipulated in the agreement. These incentives were taken as a reduction to property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets
and cash receipts are reflected as investing cash inflows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
