**18.** **SET-OFF**

(a) At any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, the Collateral Agent and each other
Secured Creditor may (but shall not be obliged to) set-off any matured liability owed by a Chargor under any
Credit Document against any obligation (whether or not matured) owed by the Collateral Agent or such other
Secured Creditor to such Chargor, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either
obligation.

(b) If the obligations are in different currencies, the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Creditor may convert
either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

(c) If either obligation is unliquidated or unascertained, the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Creditor may set
off in an amount estimated by it in good faith to be the amount of that obligation.

**19.** **DELEGATION**

Each of the Collateral Agent and any Receiver may delegate, by power of attorney (or in any other manner) to any person, any right, power
or discretion exercisable by them under this Deed upon any terms (including power to sub-delegate) which it may reasonably think fit.
Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Receiver shall be in any way liable or responsible to any Chargor for any loss or liability arising from
any act, default, omission or misconduct on the part of any Delegate unless arising as a result of its gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in so delegating.

**20.** **FURTHER ASSURANCES**

Security Asset or the exercise of any rights, powers and remedies properly exercisable by the Collateral Agent,
