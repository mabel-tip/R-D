purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled $1.58
billion, $594 million and $419 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive
regulatory credits was $21 million and $140 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to recognize the majority of the deferred revenue
as of December 31, 2020 in the next 12 months.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying
customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles
to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing
transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record
the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $752 million,
$532 million and $393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred $293 million and
$218 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual
leases.

Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option

We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where
we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to
recognize these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing
partner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing
collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle
and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within
deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest
expense based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We
capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to
cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized
during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no
material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating
cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or
paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale
value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing
partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue.
The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $42 million and $214 million as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including $23 million within a 12-month period from December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we
had $42 million and $238 million, respectively, of such borrowings recorded in accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities and $11 million and
$29 million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $77 million, $186
million and $332 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program. The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was
$43 million and $190 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
