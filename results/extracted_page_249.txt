(d) if any Interest Period for a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest
Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any Interest Period for a LIBOR Loan would otherwise
expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day;

(e) no Interest Period may be selected at any time when an Event of Default is then in existence if either the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have elected, upon notice to the Borrowers, to not permit such selection in its or their sole
discretion; and

(f) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing shall be selected which extends beyond the Final Maturity Date.

If by 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day (or with respect to any Loan denominated in Euros or an
Acceptable Foreign Currency, the fourth Business Day) prior to the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of LIBOR
Loans, any Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans as
provided above, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected (i) in respect of U.S. Dollar Denominated Revolving Loans to convert such
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period and (ii) in respect of Loans
denominated in Euros or an Acceptable Foreign Currency, a one-month Interest Period (provided that with respect to this clause (ii), if the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have elected not to permit the selection of an Interest Period pursuant to clause (e) above,
then on the expiration of the then-applicable Interest Period, such Loans shall be repaid).

2.10. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only
by the Administrative Agent):

(i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement
affecting the London interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the
basis provided for in the definition of LIBO Rate (including because the applicable Screen Rate is not published on a current
basis); or

(ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or
receivable hereunder with respect to any LIBOR Loan because of any change since the Effective Date in any applicable law or
governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation or
administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or
request, such as, but not limited to: (A) any change that would subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any taxes
(except for Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, (B) a change in official reserve
requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of
the LIBO Rate or (C) any change that imposes on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or
expense (other than taxes)
