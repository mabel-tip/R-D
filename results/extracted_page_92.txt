Award”), as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely
on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as
both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance
Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for
the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing
average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of
the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation
and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share as adjusted to give
effect to the Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously
sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.

The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2020 was as follows:

**Total Annualized Revenue** **Annualized Adjusted EBITDA**
**Milestone** **Milestone**
**(in billions)** **Achievement Status** **(in billions)** **Achievement Status**

$ 20.0 Achieved and certified $ 1.5 Achieved and certified
$ 35.0 Probable $ 3.0 Achieved and certified
$ 55.0 - $ 4.5 Achieved and certified
$ 75.0 - $ 6.0 Probable
$ 100.0 - $ 8.0 Probable
$ 125.0 - $ 10.0 $ 150.0 - $ 12.0 $ 175.0 - $ 14.0 
Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and
administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have
recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of
operational milestones that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles.

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future
time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement
time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve
each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to achieve that
operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.” When we first determine that an operational milestone has become probable
of being achieved, we allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the then-applicable “expected
vesting time.” The “expected vesting time” at any given time is the later of (i) the expected operational milestone achievement time (if the related operational
milestone has not yet been achieved) and (ii) the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time (if the related market capitalization milestone has
not yet been achieved). We immediately recognize a catch-up expense for all accumulated expense for the quarters from the grant date through the quarter in
which the operational milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved. Each quarter thereafter, we recognize the prorated portion of the then-remaining
expense for the tranche based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the then-applicable expected vesting time, except that upon vesting of a
tranche, all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized.

As a result, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant catch-up expenses in quarters when one or more operational milestones
are first determined to be probable of being achieved. Additionally, the expected market capitalization achievement times are generally later than the related
expected operational milestone achievement times. Therefore, if market capitalization milestones are achieved earlier than originally forecasted, for example
due to periods of rapid stock price appreciation, this has resulted, and may result in the future, in higher catch-up expenses and the remaining expenses being
recognized over shorter periods of time at a higher per-quarter rate.
