Between January 1, 2021 and February 5, 2021, we have received additional conversion notices on our 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes for $62 million and
$623 million in aggregate principal amounts, respectively, for which we intend to settle the principal amounts in cash during the three months ended March 31,
2021.

Investments

In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not
required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets.
Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our
products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.

We will account for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other. The digital assets are
initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.
We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price
quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of operations.

The cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. Gains (if
any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale.
