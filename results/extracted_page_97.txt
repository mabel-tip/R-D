As of December 31, 2020, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $353 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is
currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U.S., California and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the
years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2014 and 2019 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years
2004 to 2019 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to
adjustment for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2019 remain subject to examination in other U.S. state and foreign
jurisdictions.

The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. However, we
cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.

The U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing
arrangement. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit) reversed the Tax Court decision and upheld the validity of Treas. Reg. Section
1.482-7A(d)(2), requiring stock-based compensation costs be included in the costs shared under a cost sharing agreement. On June 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme
Court denied to review the Ninth Circuit decision. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s denial, Tesla has already included stock-based compensation in cost
sharing allocation agreement and hence retains its position.

**Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies**

**Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York**

We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) with respect to Gigafactory
New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. The SUNY
Foundation covered (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to $350 million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing
equipment in an amount up to $275 million and (iii) $125 million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, subject to the maximum funding
allocation from the State of New York; and we were responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The SUNY Foundation owns
the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the manufacturing facility, we have
commenced leasing of the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years, with an
option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the
State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in
the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of
such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” to
the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then
additional amounts may become payable by us.
