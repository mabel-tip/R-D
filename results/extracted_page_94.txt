effect to the Stock Split. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both
performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a
combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared to our initial
market capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2020, the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the
following performance milestones had been achieved:

   - Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;

   - Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;

   - Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;

   - Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;

   - Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;

   - Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;

   - Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;

   - Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and

   - Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020, we had
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $6 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not record any additional stock-based compensation expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award. For the
year ended December 31, 2018, the stock-based compensation we recorded related to this award was immaterial.

**Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information**

The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):

Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative
losses and valuation allowances. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our
consolidated balance sheets was $89 million, $52 million and $18 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.51 billion of total unrecognized
stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.
