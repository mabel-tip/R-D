markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which are under
construction.

**Supply Chain**

Our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships
with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or
are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.

As is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources
are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks
owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy
procurement lead times.

Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market
conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term
supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in
order to meet the needs of our operations.

**Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations**

Globally, both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs,
incentives and other arrangements. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.

**Programs and Incentives**

**California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives**

We have agreements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that provide multi-year sales tax
exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes, including the expansion and ongoing development of electric
vehicles and powertrain production in California.

**Gigafactory Nevada—Nevada Tax Incentives**

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that
provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits in consideration of capital investment and hiring
targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the incentive.

**Gigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease**

We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) with respect to Gigafactory New York.
Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply
with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets.

As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in
March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a one-year deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under
such agreement on April 30, 2020, which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020.

**Gigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits**

We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are
required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government
has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary in 2019 and 2020 certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at
Gigafactory Shanghai. Finally, the Shanghai government granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, which is lower
than the 25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this lower rate for 2019 through 2023.
