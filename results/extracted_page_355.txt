from those being charged by the respective Lender prior to such transfer, then no Borrower shall be obligated to pay such increased costs
or taxes (although the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay any other increased costs and taxes of the type described
above resulting from changes after the date of the respective transfer).

13.1513.16. Register. Each Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as its agent, solely for
purposes of this Section 13.1513.16, to maintain a register (the “Register”) on which it will record the Revolving Loan Commitments from
time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of, and
stated interest on, the Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any
Borrower’s obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Revolving Loan Commitment of such
Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Revolving Loan Commitment shall not be
effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such
Revolving Loan Commitment and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Revolving
Loan Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any
Revolving Loan Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the
Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to
Section 13.0413.05(b). Upon such acceptance and recordation, the assignee specified therein shall be treated as a Lender for all purposes
of this Agreement. Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for
acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or
transferor Lender shall surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender at the request of any such Lender. The
Register shall be available for inspection by each Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Lender at the office of the Administrative Agent at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

13.1613.17. Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this Section 13.1613.17, each Agent and each
Lender agrees not to disclose without the prior consent of the Company (other than on a need to know basis to such Agent’s or such
Lender’s directors, officers, employees, insurers, re-insurers and agents, including auditors, advisors or counsel, in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or to another Agent or Lender if such Lender or such Lender’s holding or parent
company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access to such information, provided such Persons shall be
subject to the provisions of this Section 13.1613.17 to the same extent as such Lender) any information with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which is now or in the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document by or on behalf of
a Credit Party, provided that any Agent or Lender may disclose any such information (i) as has become generally available to the public
other than by virtue of a breach of this Section 13.1613.17(a) by the respective Agent or Lender, (ii) as may be required or appropriate in
any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or Federal regulatory body (including any self-regulatory body, such
as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Agent or Lender or to the Board
or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors (in
