(d) With respect to the Extension consummated by the Company pursuant to this Section 2.19, (i) the Extension shall not
constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of this Agreement (including Section 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 13.02 or
13.0613.07), (ii) if the amount extended is less than the Maximum Letter of Credit Amount, the Maximum Letter of Credit Amount shall be
reduced upon the date that is five Business Days prior to the 2023 ExtendedInitial Maturity Date (to the extent needed so that the
Maximum Letter of Credit Amount does not exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments which would be in effect after the 2023
ExtendedInitial Maturity Date), and, if applicable, the Company shall cash collateralize obligations under any issued Letters of Credit with
a termination date (taking into account any possible extensions thereof) later than five Business Days prior to the 2023 ExtendedInitial
Maturity Date in an amount equal to 102% of the Stated Amount of such Letters of Credit that are in excess of the proposed reduced
Maximum Letter of Credit Amount, and (iii) if the amount extended is less than the Maximum Swingline Amount, the Maximum Swingline
Amount shall be reduced upon the date that is five Business Days prior to the 2023 ExtendedInitial Maturity Date (to the extent needed so
that the Maximum Swingline Amount does not exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments which would be in effect after the 2023
ExtendedInitial Maturity Date), and, if applicable, the Company shall prepay any outstanding Swingline Loans in excess of the Maximum
Swingline Amount that is then in effect. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the Extensions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.19 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest or fees in respect of any
Extended Revolving Loan Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of
any provision of this Agreement (including Section 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 13.02 or 13.0613.07) or any other Credit Document that may
otherwise prohibit the Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.19; provided that such consent shall not be
deemed to be an acceptance of the Extension Offer.

(e) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent on behalf of all of the Lenders to enter into
amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with the Credit Parties as may be necessary in order establish new
tranches in respect of Revolving Loan Commitments so extended and such amendments as may be necessary in connection with the
establishment of such new tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.19 and without any requirement of additional
consent by any Lender. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with the Extension, the respective parties shall (at the expense of
the Credit Parties) amend (and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to amend) any Credit Document that has a maturity date
prior to the Extended Final Maturity Date so that such maturity date is extended to the Extended Final Maturity Date (or such later date
as may be advised by local counsel to the Administrative Agent).

(f) In connection with the Extension, the Company shall provide the Administrative Agent at least 10 Business Daysâ€™ (or
such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any,
as may be reasonably established by, or reasonably acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish
the purposes of this Section 2.19.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender with Initial Revolving Loan
Commitments may agree after the Amendment and Restatement Effective Date to convert all or a portion of such Initial Revolving
Loan Commitments to 2023 Extended Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to an agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, duly executed by such Lender, the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent, without any requirement of additional consent by any other Lender. Thereafter,
