Automotive & Services and Other Segment

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and
reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the
carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted
demand.

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, cost of goods sold associated with direct
sales-type leases which were introduced in volume in the third quarter of 2020, as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive
leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles
under our leasing programs.

Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles,
costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs and
manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.

2020 compared to 2019

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $3.76 billion, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to an increase of 129,268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. Due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the
year ended December 31, 2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and if customers elect to
exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue
of $451 million. We made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of $42 million during
the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, there was an increase to cost of automotive sales revenue from idle capacity charges of $213 million as a
result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. These factors increasing cost of
automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit due to lower material, manufacturing, freight and duty costs
from localized procurement and manufacturing in China and a higher sales mix of lower end trims, as well as a decrease of 8,669 Model S and Model X cash
deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.
