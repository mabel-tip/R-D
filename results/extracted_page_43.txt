compensation expense primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price,
$20 million increase in facilities, freight and depreciation expenses and a $20 million increase in employee and labor related expenses.

R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5.5% to 4.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily an increase in total revenues from expanding sales, partially offset by an increase in our R&D expenses as
detailed above.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales,
executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation
settlements.

SG&A expenses increased $499 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase
is primarily due to an increase of $625 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $542 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance
Award. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $838 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 for the 2018 CEO Performance Award compared
to $296 million in the prior year. Of the expense recorded in fiscal year 2020, $232 million was due to cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided
from the grant date when three operational milestones under such award were considered probable of being met and the remaining unamortized expense of
$357 million for the first four tranches were recognized upon vesting as the first four market capitalization milestones were achieved (see Note 14, Equity
Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The remaining stock-based compensation
expense increase of $83 million attributable to other directors and employees is primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher
grant date fair values due to our increased share price. The increase in stock-based compensation was partially offset by a decrease of $90 million in customer
promotional costs, facilities-related expenses and sales and marketing activities. Additionally, there was a reduction to operating expenses for costs previously
incurred in the amount of $43 million for the settlement in part of the securities litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition (see Note 16, Commitments and
Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11% to 10% in year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019. The decrease is primarily from an increase in total revenues from expanding sales, partially offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses as detailed
above.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency.   There were
no restructuring actions in the year ended December 31, 2020.
