For two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for its obligations under the
contractual agreements.

Each lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the
placed-in-service dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon date. As part of this mechanism, the master lease prepayment
amount is updated, and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any
additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease pass-through financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would
reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.

**Note 19 – Defined Contribution Plan**

We have a 401(k) savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants
are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
(other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation).

**Note 20 – Related Party Transactions**

In November 2018, our CEO purchased from us 284,575 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a per share price equal to the last closing
price of our stock prior to the execution of the purchase agreement for an aggregate $20 million, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

In May 2019, our CEO purchased from us 514,400 shares of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $25
million, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

In February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from us 65,185 and 6,250 shares, respectively, of our common stock in a
public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $10 million and $1 million, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

In June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an interim term of 90 days. During the interim term, we resumed our
annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-inplace requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million.

Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage to us during the
interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $100 million. In return, we paid our CEO a total of $3 million, which
represents the market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50%. Following the lapse of the
90-day period, we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy with third-party carriers.
