transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 29.7 million shares of our
common stock at a price of $121.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the
conversion of the 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $61.97 to $121.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain
accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost
incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated
balance sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2024 Notes on at
least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2024 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified $171 million,
of the carrying value of the 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $43 million, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate
principal of our 2024 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2024 Notes would be in cash, shares of our
common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the remaining liability is classified as non-current. The debt discounts recorded on the 2024 Notes are
recognized as interest expense through May 2024 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through December 31, 2020,
including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $558 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes were converted for $558 million in cash and
8.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $31
million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the
2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 8.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle
under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding
principal amount by $13.32 billion.

**2025 Notes**

In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities
Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 billion.

**Credit Agreement**

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate
of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts
receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

In March 2020, we upsized the Credit Agreement by $100 million, which matures July 2023, to $2.525 billion. In June 2020, $197 million of commitment
under the Credit Agreement expired in accordance with its terms and the total commitment decreased to $2.328 billion  .

**Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020**

In December 2015, SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) issued $113 million in aggregate principal amount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
on December 1, 2020 in a private placement. $13 million of these notes were issued to related parties.
