2019, primarily due to an increase of 129,268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of
production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. We were able to increase deliveries year over year from production
ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. There was also an increase of $986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to $1.58
billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended December 31,
2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles
previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales revenue of $555 million. We made further pricing
adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of automotive sales revenue of $72 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The smaller
reduction in revenue from pricing adjustments resulted in a positive impact to automotive sales revenue of $483 million year over year. These factors increasing
automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y. Despite the inclusion of higher
priced Model Y deliveries in 2020, the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y decreased due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range
variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was a decrease in automotive sales revenue from 8,669 fewer Model S and Model X
cash deliveries at a relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.

Automotive leasing revenue increased $183 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct sales-type leasing programs which
we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the
customer. These increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs
accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.

Services and other revenue increased $80 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, an increase in retail merchandise revenue and
an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our mid-year 2019 acquisitions.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in non-Tesla trade-ins.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such
products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.

2020 compared to 2019

Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $463 million, or 30%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack, solar cash and loan jobs and Powerwall, partially offset by a decrease in
deployments of Powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy. Powerpack deployments
have decreased following the introduction of our Megapack product, which we began deploying in late 2019.
