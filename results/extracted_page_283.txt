will, upon the Administrative Agent’s written request, furnish to the Administrative Agent, within 45 days after the date the payment of
any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by such Borrower (or other Credit
Party) or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(b) Subject to Section 14.07, the U.S. Borrowers (jointly and severally) or the Dutch Borrowers (jointly and severally) or

relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for
the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(c) Subject to Section 14.07, the U.S. Borrowers (jointly and severally) or the Dutch Borrowers (jointly and severally) or
the UK Borrowers (jointly and severally) shall, as applicable, agree (and the applicable Subsidiary Guarantors agree) to indemnify each
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified
Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such
Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative
Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Credit Parties, subject to Section 14.07, to do so), (ii) any taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.0413.05(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Credit Document or otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this
clause (d).

(e) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments
made under any Credit Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by
the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or
the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition,
any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative
