Dear Sirs

Re: **[Chargor] - Security over Bank Accounts**

We notify you that each of [insert names of Chargors] (the “Chargors”) has charged to [the Collateral Agent] (the “Collateral Agent”) for
the benefit of itself and certain other banks and financial institutions all their right, title and interest in and to the monies from time to
time standing to the credit of the accounts identified in the schedule to this notice (the “Charged Accounts”) and to all interest (if any)
accruing on the Charged Accounts by way of a security agreement dated [●] (the “Security Agreement”).

1 Prior to the receipt by you of a notice from the Collateral Agent specifying that an Account Control Event is continuing, the
Chargors will have the sole right: (i) to operate and transact business in relation to the Charged Accounts (including making
withdrawals from and effecting closures of the Charged Accounts), and (ii) to deal with you in relation to the Charged
Accounts.

2 Following receipt by you of a written notice from the Collateral Agent specifying that an Account Control Event is continuing,
the Chargors irrevocably authorise you:

(a) to hold all monies from time to time standing to the credit of the Charged Accounts to the order of the Collateral
Agent and to pay all or any part of those monies to the Collateral Agent (or as it may direct) promptly following
receipt of written instructions from the Collateral Agent to that effect; and

(b) subject to the requirements of applicable law, to disclose to the Collateral Agent any information relating to the
Chargors and the Charged Accounts which the Collateral Agent may from time to time request you to provide.

3 This notice may only be revoked or varied with the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent and the Chargors.

4 Please sign and return the enclosed copy of this notice to the Collateral Agent (with a copy to the Chargors) by way of your
confirmation that:

(a) you agree to act in accordance with the provisions of this notice;

(b) you have not previously received notice (other than notices which were subsequently irrevocably and
unconditionally withdrawn) that any Chargor has assigned its rights to the monies standing to the credit of the
Charged Accounts or otherwise granted any security or other interest over those monies in favour of any third
party;
