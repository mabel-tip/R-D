NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors and hereby covenants and agrees with each other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Secured Creditors as follows:

1. GUARANTY. Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees as
a primary obligor and not merely as surety to the Secured Creditors the full and prompt payment when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise) of (i) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes issued by, and the Loans made to, the UK Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and all reimbursement obligations and
Unpaid Drawings with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of a UK Borrower and (ii) all other obligations (including, without
limitation, obligations which, but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due), liabilities and
indebtedness owing by the UK Borrowers to the Secured Creditors under the Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document to which
any UK Borrower is a party (including, without limitation, indemnities, Fees and expenses in respect of which a UK Borrower is obligated
and interest thereon (including, without limitation, in each case any interest, fees or expenses accruing after the commencement of any
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding at the rate provided for in the Credit Agreement, whether or not such interest,
fees or expenses are an allowed claim in any such proceeding)), whether now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in
connection with each such Credit Document (all such principal, premium, interest, reimbursement obligations, Unpaid Drawings,
liabilities, indebtedness and obligations being herein collectively called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Guaranteed Obligations of any Guarantor include any Obligations of any U.S. Borrower, any U.S. Subsidiary Guarantor, any
Dutch Borrower or any Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor.

Each Guarantor understands, agrees and confirms that the Secured Creditors may enforce this Guaranty up to the full amount
of the Guaranteed Obligations against such Guarantor without proceeding against any other Guarantor or any other guarantor of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any Borrower, or against any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or under any other guaranty covering all
or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty is a guaranty of prompt payment and performance and not of collection. For
purposes of this Guaranty, the term “Guarantor” as applied to any Borrower shall refer to such Borrower as a guarantor of indebtedness
incurred by another Borrower, and not indebtedness directly incurred by such Borrower.

The following capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions specified below: “Termination  Date” shall mean the date
upon which the Total Revolving Loan Commitment under the Credit Agreement has been terminated, no Note is outstanding (and all
Loans and Unpaid Drawings have been paid in full), all Letters of Credit have been terminated (or have been cash collateralized or
backstopped by another letter of credit, in either case on terms and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders (which arrangements, in any event, shall require such cash collateral or backstop
letter of credit to be in a stated amount equal to at least 102% of the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such
time)), and all other Guaranteed Obligations (other than indemnities and other contingent payment obligations under the Credit
Documents which are not then due and payable) then due and payable have been paid in full.

Additionally, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, guarantees the payment of any
and all Guaranteed Obligations whether or not due and payable by any UK
