in full or if no Swingline Loans are outstanding, its respective Revolving Loans, in each case in such
amount as may be required to cause the conditions giving rise to such mandatory repayment requirement
to cease to exist on such day, and

(D) in the case of a repayment and/or cash collateralization required pursuant to Section
5.02(a)(i)(yx) on any day, each respective Borrower shall repay on such day the principal of its outstanding
Swingline Loans in such amount as may be required to cause the conditions giving rise to such mandatory
repayment requirement to cease to exist on such day.

(iii) If after giving effect to the prepayment of all Loans and in the circumstances described in
Section 5.02(a)(i)(zy), the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(a)(i) continue to exist, the respective Borrowers shall
pay to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on such day an amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal
to 100% of the amount of such excess (or, in the case of a termination of the Total Revolving Loan Commitment,
102% of the amount of such excess), such cash and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as security for all Obligations of
the Borrowers to the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral account to be established by,
and under the sole dominion and control of, the Administrative Agent (and which cash and/or Cash Equivalents may,
without limiting the Borrowersâ€™ obligations in respect thereof, be paid to and applied by the Issuing Lenders and/or
the Lenders in satisfaction of the Obligations of the applicable Borrowers to the Issuing Lenders and/or Lenders in
respect of any Drawings made under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower on the maturity
date thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will cash or Cash Equivalents of any Dutch Borrower or UK

(b) With respect to each repayment of Loans required by this Section 5.02, the Borrowers may designate the
Types of Loans which are to be repaid and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the specific Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which

to the order of priorities set forth therein); provided that: (i) repayments of LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.02 made on
a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be subject to Section 2.11; (ii) if any repayment of
LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding LIBOR Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing
to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, such Borrowing shall be automatically converted
into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans and (iii) each repayment of any Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be
applied pro rata among the Lenders holding such Revolving Loans. In the absence of a designation by a Borrower as described
in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion.

(c) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this Section 5.02, (i) all then outstanding
Swingline Loans shall be repaid in full on the earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day following the date the incurrence of such
Swingline Loans and (y) the Swingline Expiry Date and (ii) all then outstanding Revolving Loans shall be repaid in full on the
