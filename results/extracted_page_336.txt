12.02. Nature of Duties. (a) The Administrative Agent in its capacity as such shall not have any duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
such nor any of its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder
or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of the Administrative
Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or in any other
Credit Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations
in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

the Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents are named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such
shall have no powers, duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; it being understood and agreed that the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents and the CoDocumentation Agents shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Administrative Agent as, and to the
extent, provided for under Sections 12.06 and 13.01. Without limitation of the foregoing, none of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents
and the Co-Documentation Agents shall, solely by reason of this Agreement or any other Credit Documents, have any fiduciary relationship
in respect of any Lender or any other Person.

12.03. Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (a) its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the continuance
of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (b) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information
with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information,
representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the financial
condition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.

12.04. Certain Rights of the Agents. If the Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Required Lenders
with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received instructions from
