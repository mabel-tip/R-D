**Note 18 – Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation**

Through December 31, 2020, we had entered into eight transactions referred to as “lease pass-through fund arrangements”. Under these arrangements,
our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an
initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25
years. These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

The cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.05 billion. The
accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $137 million and $101 million, respectively. The total lease pass-through
financing obligation as of December 31, 2020 was $68 million, of which $41 million is classified as a current liability. The total lease pass-through financing
obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $94 million, of which $57 million was classified as a current liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is
included in accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheets.

Under a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some
cases, subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs, which is estimated by
discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately. We account for the remainder of the
investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing obligation, which is repaid from the future customer
lease payments and any incentive rebates. A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate
method.

The lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed in-service and the associated
customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors. In addition, we are responsible for any warranties, performance guarantees, accounting and
performance reporting. Furthermore, we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements,
regardless of whether the cash is received by us or directly by the investors.
