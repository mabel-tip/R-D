**26.1** **Ruling off**

(a) If the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor receives, or is deemed to be affected by, notice, whether
actual or constructive, of any subsequent Security (other than any Permitted Encumbrances) affecting any
Security Asset and/or the proceeds of sale of any Security Asset or any guarantee under the Credit Documents
ceases to continue in force, it may open a new account or accounts for any Chargor. If it does not open a new
account, it shall nevertheless be treated as if it had done so at the time when it received or was deemed to have
received such notice.

(b) As from that time all payments made to the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Creditor will be credited or be
treated as having been credited to the new account and will not operate to reduce any amount of the Secured
Obligations.

**26.2** **Tacking**

(a) Each Secured Creditor shall perform its obligations under the Credit Documents (including any obligation to make
available further advances).

(b) This Deed secures advances already made and further advances to be made under the Credit Agreement that
constitute Secured Obligations.

**26.3** **Protective clause**

Each Chargor is deemed to be a principal debtor in relation to this Deed. The obligations of each Chargor under, and the security intended
to be created by, this Deed shall not be impaired by any forbearance, neglect, indulgence, extension of time, release, surrender or loss of
securities, dealing, amendment or arrangement by any Secured Creditor which would otherwise have reduced, released or prejudiced the
Security created by or pursuant to this Deed or any surety liability of a Chargor (whether or not known to it or to any Secured Creditor).

**27.** **CALCULATIONS AND CERTIFICATES**

Any certificate of or determination by a Secured Creditor, or the Collateral Agent specifying the amount of any Secured Obligation due
from the Chargors (including details of any relevant calculation thereof) is, in the absence of manifest error, prima facie evidence against
the Chargors of the matters to which it relates.

**28.** **PARTIAL INVALIDITY**

All the provisions of this Deed are severable and distinct from one another and if at any time any provision is or becomes illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of any of the remaining
provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction will in any way be affected or
impaired.

**29.** **REMEDIES AND WAIVERS**
