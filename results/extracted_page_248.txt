Period plus the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal or interest on any Loan, any Letter of Credit fee or any other amount
payable by a Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount

Commitment, and (z) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

(d) Upon each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine the LIBO Rate for each Interest
Period applicable to the respective LIBOR Loans and shall promptly notify the respective Borrowers and the Lenders thereof. Each such
determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

2.09. Interest Periods. At the time any Borrower gives any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in

subsequent Interest Period), such Borrower shall have the right to elect the interest period (each, an “Interest Period”) applicable to such
LIBOR Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of such Borrower, be (x) a one, two, three or six month period, or (y) with the
consent of the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, a period of less than one month or (z) to the extent agreed to by all Lenders,
such other period; provided that (in each case):
