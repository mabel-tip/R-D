Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products and technologies
including our announced proprietary battery cells, ongoing production and additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the
Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, and the
continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities.

As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2021 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be $4.50 to $6.00 billion in 2021 and in each of the next two fiscal years.

We expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our
near-term debt obligations, although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to
support construction and production at Gigafactory Shanghai. See Note 12, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid
growth of our business.

In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not
required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets.
Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our
products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. We believe our bitcoin
holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to
liquidate them.


We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New
York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018, which we expect to meet through our operations. As we temporarily suspended most of our
manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
we were granted a one-year deferral of our obligation to be compliant as of April 30, 2020 with our applicable targets under such agreement.

We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity
over at least the next 12 months, even considering the expected levels of capital expenditures in the current and next two fiscal years. A large portion of our
future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our
product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. For example, if our near-term manufacturing
operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic conditions and levels of consumer outlook and spend
impacting demand in the worldwide transportation, automotive and energy product industries, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital
expenditures. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If
we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.

In addition, we had $2.63 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2020, some of which
are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased
vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets;
and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases
into the financing funds). For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 12, Debt, and Note 17, Variable Interest Entity
Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
