owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single family homeowners and multi family residential entities to deploy home
charging solutions.

**In-App Upgrades**

As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla
app. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels.
We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer
acquisition costs.

In the U.S., we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of
channel partners. Outside of the U.S., we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell these products for the
residential market. We also sell Powerwall directly to utilities. In the case of products sold to utilities or channel partners, such partners typically sell the
product and manage the installation in customer homes.

We sell our commercial and utility-scale energy storage systems to customers through our U.S. and international sales organization and our channel
partner network. In certain jurisdictions, we also sell installed solar energy systems (with or without energy storage) to commercial customers through cash,
lease and PPA transactions.

**Service and Warranty**

**Automotive**

**Service**

We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work
remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Performing vehicle service ourselves provides us with the capability to identify problems and implement
solutions and improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory better, than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The
connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.

**Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans**

We provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell, which may include separate limited warranties on certain
components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new
vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable.

**Energy Storage Systems**

We generally provide manufacturer’s limited warranties with every new energy storage product and offer certain extended limited warranties that are
available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship. As part of our
energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the
minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract.

**Solar Energy Systems**

For retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we provide limited
warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties. As
part of our solar energy system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or
exceed the minimum energy generation requirements specified in the contract.
