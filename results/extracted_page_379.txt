No invalidity, illegality, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Credit Documents or any other
agreement or instrument relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security or guarantee therefor shall affect, impair or be a
defense to this Guaranty, and this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or
the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except the
occurrence of the Termination Date.

6. CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may
apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of
any Secured Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any
Secured Creditor would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Secured Creditor to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. It is not necessary for any Secured Creditor to inquire into the capacity or
powers of any UK Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its or their behalf, and any
indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

7. SUBORDINATION OF INDEBTEDNESS HELD BY GUARANTORS. Any indebtedness of any UK Borrower now
or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations of such UK Borrower to the Secured Creditors;
and the indebtedness of such UK Borrower to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, after an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, so requests, to the extent such indebtedness constitutes Collateral shall be collected, enforced and
received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Creditors and be paid over to the Secured Creditors on account of the Guaranteed
Obligations of such UK Borrower to the Secured Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor
under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the
Secured Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty
(whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provisions under applicable law or otherwise) until
the Termination Date; provided, that if any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior
to the Termination Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Creditors and shall promptly be paid to the
Secured Creditors to be credited and applied upon the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the
terms of the Credit Documents or, if the Credit Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Secured
Creditors as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing.

8. GUARANTY ENFORCEABLE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR COLLATERAL AGENT. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Guaranty, the Secured Creditors agree (by their acceptance of the benefits of this
Guaranty) that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in each case acting
upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to
enforce this Guaranty or to realize upon the security to be granted by the Security Documents, it being understood and agreed that such
rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, for the benefit of the
Secured
