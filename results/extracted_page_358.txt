(b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date
of actual payment of the amount due, each Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but
in any event not a lesser amount), as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the
rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate or exchange prevailing on the Judgment
Currency Conversion Date.

(c) For purposes of determining any rate of exchange for this Section, such amounts shall include any premium and costs
payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

13.2113.22. OTHER LIENS ON COLLATERAL; TERMS OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT; ETC..  (a) EACH LENDER
UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT LIENS MAY BE CREATED ON THE COLLATERAL PURSUANT TO THE
PERMITTED ADDITIONAL SECURED INDEBTEDNESS DOCUMENTS, WHICH LIENS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT. THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL
PROVIDE, IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
CREDIT DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL.

(b) EACH LENDER AUTHORIZES AND INSTRUCTS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT TO
ENTER INTO THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, AND TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS (AND EXECUTE ALL
DOCUMENTS) REQUIRED (OR DEEMED ADVISABLE) BY IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INTERCREDITOR
AGREEMENT.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 13.2113.22 ARE NOT INTENDED TO SUMMARIZE ALL RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF
THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT. REFERENCE MUST BE MADE TO THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ITSELF TO UNDERSTAND
ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THEREOF. EACH LENDER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING ITS OWN ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE
INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS THEREOF, AND NEITHER THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION TO ANY LENDER AS TO THE SUFFICIENCY OR ADVISABILITY OF THE
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

13.2213.23. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Credit Document, the
interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Credit Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by
applicable law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the
Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the
Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the
Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
