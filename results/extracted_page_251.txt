Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document and subject to the proviso
below in this paragraph, solely with respect to a US Dollar Loan, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark
Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the
applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Credit
Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further
action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that, this clause (ii) shall not be
effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the U.S. Borrower a Term SOFR Notice.

(iii) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have
the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit
Document.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the
circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth
in clause (a)(i) have not arisen but any of (v) a prevailing market convention is emerging in respect of syndicated loans currently being
executed, or existing syndicated loans with provisions similar to this paragraph are being amended, to incorporate or adopt a new
benchmark interest rate to replace LIBO Rate (including the Screen Rates included in such definition), (w) the supervisor for the
administrator of the applicable Screen Rate has made a public statement that the administrator of such Screen Rate is insolvent (and
there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of such Screen Rate), (x) the administrator of such Screen Rate has
made a public statement identifying a specific date after which such Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by
it (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of such Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the administrator of
such Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which such Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely
cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of such Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which such Screen Rate may no longer be used for
determining interest rates for loans, the Administrative Agent and the respective Borrower or Borrowers shall endeavor to establish an
alternate rate of interest to such Screen Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate
of interest for syndicated loans in the United States in the applicable currency at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this
Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any)
incorporated therein, but for the avoidance of doubt, such changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Margin (it being
understood and agreed that amendments to the definition of LIBO Rate and its component definitions in accordance with the foregoing
that do not have the effect of reducing the Applicable Margin shall not constitute a reduction in the Applicable Margin)); provided that, if
such alternate rate of interest as so determined would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this
