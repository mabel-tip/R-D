(b) For the purposes of this Clause 17.1:

“Pro Rata Share” shall mean, when calculating a Secured Creditor’s portion of any distribution or amount, that amount (expressed as a
percentage) equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the then unpaid amount of such Secured Creditor’s Primary Obligations or
Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the then outstanding amount of all Primary Obligations or
Secondary Obligations owing to the applicable Secured Creditors entitled thereto, as the case may be;

“Primary Obligations” shall mean all principal of, premium, fees and interest on, all Loans made to the UK Borrowers, all Unpaid
Drawings (and all interest thereon) in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of a UK Borrower, the Stated Amount of (and the
obligation to cash collateralize) all outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the account of a UK Borrower and all Fees in respect of which a
UK Borrower (in its capacity as such) is obligated; and

“Secondary Obligations” shall mean all Obligations other than Primary Obligations.

(c) When payments to Secured Creditors are based upon their respective Pro Rata Shares, the amounts received by
such Secured Creditors hereunder shall be applied (for purposes of making determinations under this Clause 17.1
only) (i) first, to their Primary Obligations and (ii) second, to their Secondary Obligations. If any payment to any
Secured Creditor of its Pro Rata Share of any distribution would result in overpayment to such Secured Creditor,
such excess amount shall instead be distributed in respect of the unpaid Primary Obligations or Secondary
Obligations, as the case may be, of the other Secured Creditors entitled to such distribution, with each such
Secured Creditor whose Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, have not been paid in
full to receive an amount equal to such excess amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
unpaid Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of such Secured Creditor and the
denominator of which is the unpaid Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of all
Secured Creditors entitled to such distribution.

(d) Each of the Secured Creditors, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof and of the other Security Documents,
agrees and acknowledges that if the Secured Creditors receive (or are to receive) a distribution on account of
undrawn amounts with respect to Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement for the account of a UK
Borrower (which shall only occur after all outstanding Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement of any UK
Borrower and Unpaid Drawings of any UK Borrower have been paid in full), such amounts shall be paid to the
Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement and held by it, for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured
Creditors, as cash security for the repayment of Obligations owing to the Secured Creditors as such. If any
amounts are held as cash security pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, then upon the termination of
all outstanding Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement and for the account of a UK Borrower, and
after the application of all such cash security to the repayment of all Secured Obligations owing to the Secured
Creditors after giving effect to the termination of all such Letters of Credit, if there remains any excess cash, such
excess cash shall be returned by the Administrative
