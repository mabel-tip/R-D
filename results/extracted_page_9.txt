We have applied for a grant with the German government to improve the design, chemistry, manufacturing technology and recycling of lithium ion
battery cells for Gigafactory Berlin. The grant was approved by the European Commission in January 2021 and its implementation will be subject to a grant
agreement with the German government.

**Gigafactory Texas – Tax Incentives**

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would
receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School
District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting
certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas.

**Regulatory Credits**

We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel
economy, renewable energy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards,
renewable energy procurement standards and other regulatory requirements.

**Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies**

While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the
federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.

For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described
below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In
addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify
for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program.

**Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies**

U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and
to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.

In particular, Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26% of qualified commercial or residential
expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the
systems. These tax credits are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond.

**Regulations**

**Vehicle Safety and Testing**

In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements,
crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully
comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that
our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.

We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements,
consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and
foreign recalls, owner’s manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting. The U.S.
Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s
suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S.
Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and 5-star safety ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.
