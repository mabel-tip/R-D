**Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments**

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should
be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices
in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value
hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a
recurring basis were as follows (in millions):
