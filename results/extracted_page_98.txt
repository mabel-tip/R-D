such agreement on April 30, 2020, which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020. Moreover, we had
exceeded our investment and employment obligations under this agreement prior to such mandated reduction of operations. We do not currently expect any
issues meeting all applicable future obligations under this agreement. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and
operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the SUNY
Foundation.

**Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China**

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are
constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures, and to generate
RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in
accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive
compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will
be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting.

**Legal Proceedings**

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, sevenlawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla
challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of
directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The
complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’
fees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral
argument on the motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, and the
Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their
answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25,
2019, and further mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January
22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would be paid entirely
under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on
August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statement of
operations as a reduction to selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the securities litigation related to the
acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion and granted in part and denied in part
defendants’ previously-filed motion. Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due
to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The current tentative dates for the trial are from July 12 to July 23, 2021, subject to change based on any further
safety measures implemented by the Court.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for
violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the
above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate
the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.
