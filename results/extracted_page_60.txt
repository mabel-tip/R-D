(1) Due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020 and 2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that
customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options
program, which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, price
adjustments resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee by $72 million and $555 million, respectively. The amounts
presented represent automotive sales with resale value guarantee net of such pricing adjustments’ impact.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that
meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self-Driving (“FSD”)
features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle
transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and
services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle
and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to
these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle.
Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate
standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be
available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable
consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In
addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales
revenue.

Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other
obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to
automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping
and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or
accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from
the transaction price of automotive contracts.
