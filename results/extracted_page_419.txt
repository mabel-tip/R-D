(c) If and to the extent that the obligations of any Chargor under this Clause 25 (Indemnity) are unenforceable for any
reason, such Chargor hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable law.

**25.2** **Indemnity Obligations Secured by Collateral; Survival.**
Any amounts paid by any Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee has the right to reimbursement hereunder or under the other Credit

Credit issued under the Credit Agreement, the termination of all Secured Hedging Agreements entered into with the Secured Hedging
