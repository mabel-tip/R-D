Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as
research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital, especially inventory, which includes vehicles in transit. Our operating
cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, customer lease payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and
storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating
expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.54 billion to $5.94 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.40 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $2.82 billion, the
decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $533 million and $188 million of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 during the
three months ended March 31, 2019 (which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity, as this represented an interest
payment on the deeply-discounted convertible senior notes). The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the Fremont
Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue
primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of December 31, 2019, a
larger increase in operating lease vehicles as Model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and Model Y direct leasing was introduced in
the third quarter of 2020, and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $3.16 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2020, mainly for Model Y production expansion at the Fremont Factory, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and construction of
Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, and $1.33 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly for Gigafactory Shanghai construction, Model 3
production ramp and Model Y preparations. The increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by decreases of $32 million in business combinations, net
of cash acquired, and $30 million of design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems when compared to the prior year. Additionally, we received
$123 million and $46 million, respectively, of government grants in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory
Shanghai for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $12.27 billion from issuance of common stock in
public offerings in 2020, net of issuance costs, and $417 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were
partially offset by $1.99 billion of cash repayments upon early conversions of our convertible senior notes, $338 million principal repayments of our finance
leases, collateralized lease repayments of $240 million and $219 million net payments to financing fund investors. See Note 12, Debt, and Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding
our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings, respectively.

Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $1.82 billion from the issuance of the 2.00%
Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”), net of transaction costs, and $848 million from the issuance of common stock, net of underwriting
discounts, in registered public offerings, $736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain Chinese subsidiaries, $394 million of net
borrowings for automotive asset-backed notes and $174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes. These cash
inflows were partially offset by a $732 million portion of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing
activity, a $566 million repayment of our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, a purchase of convertible note hedges of $476 million in connection
with the offering of the 2024 Notes and collateralized lease repayments of $389 million.
