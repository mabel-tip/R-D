any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having
received notice thereof, (iv) the consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender shall be required in
connection with any such assignment of Revolving Loan Commitments (and related Obligations) (such consent, in any case, not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (v) the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the
assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 (provided that only one such fee shall be payable

relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Revolving Loan Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans. At the
time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.0413.05(b) to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a
United States Person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so,
provide to the Company and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate) described in Section 5.04(e) to the extent such forms would provide a complete exemption from or reduction in
U.S. federal withholding tax. In addition, each assignee Lender that is a United States Person and not already a Lender, if requested by
the relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such documentation (including Internal Revenue Service Form W-9)
prescribed by applicable law as will enable the relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is
subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender’s
Revolving Loan Commitment and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 2.13 or this Section 13.0413.05(b) would, at the
time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 2.10,
