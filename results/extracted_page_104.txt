**Note 22 â€“ Restructuring and Other**

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a result, we
recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments. We
recognized $47 million in impairment related to the IPR&D intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts and $15 million for the related
equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a loss of $37 million for closing operations in certain facilities. On the
statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges. The
employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019, while the remaining amounts were non-cash.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized
$37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The employee termination cash expenses of $27 million
were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55 million
of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain
tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small
portion of the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized settlement and legal
expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were
substantially paid by the end of 2018.
