which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all cost of revenue associated with the sales type lease upon delivery to
the customer. These increases were partially offset by the decreases in cost of automotive lease revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing
programs which are accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.

Cost of services and other revenue decreased $99 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to a decrease in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by a reduction in non-Tesla trade-ins, partially offset by increases in non-warranty
maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow and an increase in costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased.

Gross margin for total automotive increased from 21% to 26% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to an improvement of Model 3 gross margin primarily from lower material, manufacturing, freight and duty costs from localized procurement and
manufacturing in China, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of Model 3 due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range variants in
our sales mix compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase of $986 million in sales of regulatory credits and a positive impact from Model Y
deliveries in 2020 as Model Y gross margin was higher than our prior year total automotive gross margin. These increases were partially offset by idle capacity
charges of $213 million as a result of a temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020.

Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment increased from 17% to 22% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a lower proportion of services and other, which
operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business, within the segment in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, there was an
improvement in our non-warranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service
centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the
carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted
demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of
leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.

2020 compared to 2019

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $635 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack, higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our Solar Roof
ramp, increases in deployments of Powerwall and idle capacity charges of $20 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory New
York during the first half of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack.

Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12% to 1% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in our overall energy business which operated at lower gross margins as a result of
temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp. Additionally, there were lower gross margins in our solar cash and loan business from reduced
average selling prices as a result of our low cost solar strategy, partially offset by lower materials and manufacturing costs.

**Research and Development Expense**

**Year Ended December 31,** **2020 vs. 2019 Change** **2019 vs. 2018 Change**
(Dollars in millions) **2020** **2019** **2018** $ % $ %
Research and development $ 1,491 $ 1,343 $ 1,460 $ 148 11% $ (117) -8%
As a percentage of revenues 5% 5% 7%

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering
and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense.
