The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020.

The temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that, together with reduced or closed
government and third party partner operations in the year, negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020. While we resumed operations at all of
our factories worldwide, our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation, certain
payroll related expenses and property taxes. As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while
they were scaled back in the first half of 2020. This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation
reductions. Additionally, we suspended non-critical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements. As part of various
governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle
capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses. The impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were
almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits.

Automotive & Services and Other Segment

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive
manufacturers. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a
contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered.

Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale
value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019
and we began offering direct leasing for Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type
leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer, which we introduced in volume during the
third quarter of 2020.

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired
subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.
