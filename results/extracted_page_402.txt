otherwise disposed of after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, such Chargor shall,
if requested by the Collateral Agent in writing, cause the buyer to agree in writing to be subject to, and comply
with the terms of, this Clause 6. The Collateral Agent shall have the right to bring an action to enforce its rights
under this Clause 6, including, without limitation, an action seeking possession of the applicable Security Assets
and/or specific performance of this Clause 6.

If the grant of the above leases and licenses by an Chargor would breach any agreement with a third party, the affected Chargor shall
promptly notify the Collateral Agent in writing. In such event, the above leases and licenses shall be deemed effective to the fullest extent
permitted without causing such a breach, and, at the Collateral Agentâ€™s request, the affected Chargor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all third-party consents required to effect fully the above leases and licenses. The affected Chargor shall pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with obtaining any such consents.

**7.** **CONVERSION OF FLOATING CHARGE**

**7.1** **Conversion by notice**

The Collateral Agent may, by written notice to a Chargor, convert the floating charge created under this Deed into a fixed charge with
immediate effect as regards all or any of the Security Assets subject to the floating charge and specified in the notice if:

(a) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(b) it considers (acting reasonably) any Security Assets to be in danger of being seized or sold under any form of
distress, attachment, execution or other legal process.

**7.2** **Small companies**

The floating charge created under this Deed by any Chargor shall not convert into a fixed charge solely by reason of a moratorium being
obtained under the Insolvency Act 2000 (or anything done with a view to obtaining such a moratorium) in respect of such Chargor.

**7.3** **Automatic conversion**

The floating charge created under this Deed shall (in addition to the circumstances in which the same will occur under general law)
automatically convert into a fixed charge:

(a) in relation to any Security Asset which is subject to a floating charge if:

(i) that Chargor creates any Security (other than any Permitted Encumbrances) on or over the relevant
Security Asset without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent; or
(ii) any third party levies or attempts to levy any distress, execution, attachment or other legal process
against any such Security Asset that constitutes an Event of Default; or
