record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease
components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and
production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease
components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease
inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate
of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease
payments.

Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to
terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the
nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of
future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1, 2019. For historical leases, we
used the index or rate as of January 1, 2019. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of
finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense
on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term in interest expense.

The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheet:
