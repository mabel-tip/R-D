Additionally, the European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020, and there is also regulatory
uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.

**Self-Driving Vehicles**

Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on self-driving features that we
develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations specifically pertaining to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published
recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety of any vehicle, equipment or features
operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states
are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the design of advanced
driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder
the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.

Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the
U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.

**Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation**

In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and
dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile
manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service
vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state. In certain such
states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur.

Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes
to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state
licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and
service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.

**Battery Safety and Testing**

Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion
batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.

We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery
packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have
agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.

**Solar Energy—General**

We are not a “regulated utility” in the U.S., although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage
providers. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment
leases by third parties, such as our leases, PPAs and subscription agreements, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.

**Solar Energy—Net Metering**

Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to
interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by
their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net
metering or have proposed to do so.
