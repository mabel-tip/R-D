(iii) the giving of any notice, order or direction and the making of any filing or registration,

provided that no Chargor shall be required to do any act or execute any document in order to create or to perfect (as applicable) any
Security pursuant to this Clause 20.1 before such an obligation has otherwise arisen by operation of this Deed.

**20.2** **Specific security**

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 20.1 (Further action), each Chargor will promptly upon request by the Collateral Agent
execute any document contemplated by that Clause over any Security Asset which is subject to or intended to be subject to any fixed
security under this Deed (including any fixed security arising or intended to arise pursuant to Clause 7 (Conversion of Floating Charge)).

**21.** **POWER OF ATTORNEY**

Until this Security Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, each Chargor hereby constitutes and appoints the Collateral
Agent to be its attorney, irrevocably, with full power after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (in the name of such
Chargor or otherwise) to take any action which such Chargor is obliged to take under this Deed, including (without limitation) under
Clause 20.1 (Further action).

**22.** **CURRENCY CONVERSION**

All monies received or held by the Collateral Agent or any Receiver under this Deed may be converted from their existing currency into
such other currency as the Collateral Agent or the Receiver considers necessary or, following an Event of Default which is continuing,
desirable to cover the obligations and liabilities comprised in the Secured Obligations in that other currency at the exchange rate in effect
on such date, as determined by the Collateral Agent in a manner permitted by the terms of the Credit Documents. Each Chargor shall
indemnify the Collateral Agent against all costs, charges and expenses reasonably and properly incurred in relation to such conversion.
Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Receiver shall have any liability to any Chargor in respect of any loss resulting from any fluctuation
in exchange rates after any such conversion.

**23.** **CONTINUING SECURITY**

**23.1** **Continuing security**

The Security created by or pursuant to this Deed is continuing and will extend to the ultimate balance of the Secured Obligations
regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. Subject to Clause 32 (Release), this Deed shall remain in full
force and effect as a continuing security for the duration of the Security Period.

**23.2** **Additional and separate security**
