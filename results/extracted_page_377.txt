the occurrence of the Termination Date. The Secured Creditors may, at their election, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, foreclose on any collateral serving as security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the other
Secured Creditors by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to
the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Secured Creditors may have against any UK
Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to
the extent the Termination Date has occurred. Each Guarantor waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) any defense
arising out of any such election by the Secured Creditors, even though such election may operate to impair or extinguish any right of
reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any UK Borrower, any
other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party or any security.

(c) Each Guarantor has knowledge and assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each
UK Borrower’s and each other Guarantor’s financial condition, affairs and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs
hereunder, and has adequate means to obtain from each UK Borrower and each other Guarantor on an ongoing basis information relating
thereto and each UK Borrower’s and each other Guarantor’s ability to pay and perform its respective Guaranteed Obligations, and agrees to
assume the responsibility to keep so informed for so long as such Guarantor is a party to this Guaranty. Each Guarantor acknowledges and
agrees that (x) the Secured Creditors shall have no obligation to investigate the financial condition or affairs of any UK Borrower or any
other Guarantor for the benefit of such Guarantor nor to advise such Guarantor of any fact respecting, or any change in, the financial
condition, assets or affairs of any UK Borrower or any other Guarantor that might become known to any Secured Creditor at any time,
whether or not such Secured Creditor knows or believes or has reason to know or believe that any such fact or change is unknown to such
Guarantor, or might (or does) increase the risk of such Guarantor as guarantor hereunder, or might (or would) affect the willingness of
such Guarantor to continue as a Guarantor hereunder and (y) the Secured Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of
information known to them regarding any of the aforementioned circumstances or risks.

(d) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that no Secured Creditor nor any other Person shall be
under any obligation (a) to marshal any assets in favor of such Guarantor or in payment of any or all of the liabilities of any UK Borrower
under the Credit Documents or the obligation of such Guarantor hereunder or (b) to pursue any other remedy that such Guarantor may or
may not be able to pursue itself any right to which such Guarantor hereby waives.

(e) Each Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth in Section 3 hereof and in this
Section 4 is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary
to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
