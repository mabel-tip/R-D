**4.1** **Fixed charges**

Subject to Clause 8 (Excluded Assets), each Chargor charges and agrees to charge all of its present and future right, title and interest in
and to the following assets which are at any time owned by it, or in which it from time to time has an interest:

(a) by way of first fixed charge all Inventory and the benefit of all contracts, licences and warranties relating to the
same;

(b) by way of first fixed charge all Charged Accounts and all monies at any time standing to the credit of such
Charged Accounts, together with all interest from time to time accrued or accruing on such monies, any
investment made out of such monies or account and all rights to repayment of any of the foregoing;

(c) to the extent that any Assigned Asset is not effectively assigned under Clause 4.2 (Security assignments), by way of
first fixed charge all its present and future right, title and interest in, proceeds of (and claims under) each
Assigned Asset; and
