systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under construction.

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying
value. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded write-downs of $145 million, $138 million and $78 million, respectively, in cost
of revenues.

Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and
equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products. We are currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits. Completed
assets are transferred to their respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is
capitalized during periods of significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $48 million and $31 million, respectively, of interest.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1.57 billion, $1.37 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively. Gross
property, plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.28 billion and $2.08 billion, respectively, with accumulated
depreciation of $816 million and $483 million, respectively.
