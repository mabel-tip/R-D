The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing
stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders, and we may be required to deliver a significant number of
shares. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices. In addition, the
existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short
positions, or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.

Moreover, in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce
the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes.
We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that
the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates. In addition, the hedge
counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions, which could also affect the market price of our
common stock or the convertible senior notes.

**If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, such sales**
**could cause our stock price to decline.**

Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of
common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements.
We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of
our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to
satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.

**Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover**
**attempt.**

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an
acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that
limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require
us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the
effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock,
and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
