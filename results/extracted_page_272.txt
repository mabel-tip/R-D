automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Lenders to purchase participations therein
and to make payments in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.05) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders under the
applicable tranche pursuant to) the outstanding 2023 Extended Revolving Loan Commitments and any Extended Revolving Loan
Commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized 2023 Extended Revolving Loan
Commitments and the Extended Revolving Loan Commitments at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter
of Credit may be so reallocated).

3.07. Extended Revolving Loan Commitments. (iia) If the 2023 ExtendedInitial Maturity Date shall have occurred at a
time when Extended Revolving Loan Commitments are in effect, then such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been
issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make payments in respect
thereof pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.05) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders under the applicable tranche pursuant to) the
Extended Revolving Loan Commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized
Extended Revolving Loan Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit
may be so reallocated).

(b) To the extent not reallocated pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 3.07, but without limiting the obligations with
respect thereto, the applicable Borrower shall either (i) provide cash collateral with respect to such Letters of Credit on the Initial
Maturity Date or the 2023 Extended Maturity Date, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.02(b) or (ii) enter into backstop
arrangements reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Lender. If, for any reason, such cash collateral is not provided, such
backstop arrangements are not entered into and the reallocation does not occur, the Lenders under the maturing tranche shall continue to
be responsible for their participating interests in the Letters of Credit; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (A) the continuing participations of the Lenders under the maturing tranche shall be included in the calculation of the Required
Lenders (with each such Lender being deemed to have a Revolving Loan Commitment in the amount of such continued participation) and
(B) upon any subsequent repayment of the Loans, the reallocation set forth in Section 3.07(a) shall automatically and concurrently occur
to the extent of such repayment.

(c) Except to the extent of reallocations of participations pursuant to Section 3.07(a), the occurrence of the Initial Maturity
Date and the 2023 Extended Maturity Date shall have no effect upon (and shall not diminish) the percentage participations of the Lenders
under the Revolving Loan Commitments in any Letter of Credit issued before the Initial Maturity Date or the 2023 Extended Maturity
Date.

3.08. Conflict. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit application
required by an Issuing Lender (or any other document, agreement and instrument entered into by an Issuing Lender and any Borrower or
in favor of an Issuing Lender and relating to any such Letter of Credit) or if such application, document, agreement or instrument imposes
materially more burdensome representations or covenants than those contained in Section 8, 9 or 10, the terms hereof shall control.
