defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any
nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to
excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential
or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lender's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.

(c) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender at any time that any Letter of Credit is outstanding, the U.S. Borrowers or,
the Dutch Borrowers or the UK Borrowers, as applicable, shall enter into Letter of Credit Back-Stop Arrangements with the relevant
Issuing Lender or Issuing Lenders no later than two Business Days after the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender to the extent
required by Section 2.15(a).

3.06. Increased Costs. If at any time after the Effective Date, the introduction of or any change in any applicable law,
rule, regulation, order, guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant with any request or
directive by the NAIC or by any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall either (a) impose, modify or
make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy, liquidity or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by any Issuing
Lender or participated in by any Participant, or (b) impose on any Issuing Lender or any Participant any other conditions relating, directly
or indirectly, to this Agreement or any Letter of Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Issuing Lender
or any Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable
by any Issuing Lender or any Participant hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect to Letters of Credit (except for
Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes), then, within 10 days after the delivery of the certificate referred to below to the Borrowers by any
Issuing Lender or any Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the
Administrative Agent), the U.S. Borrowers (jointly and severally with respect to U.S. Borrower Obligations) and, the Dutch Borrowers
(jointly and severally with respect to Dutch Borrower Obligations) and the UK Borrowers (jointly and severally with respect to UK
Borrower Obligations) agree to pay to such Issuing Lender or such Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Issuing Lender or such Participant for such increased cost or reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its
capital. Any Issuing Lender or any Participant, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable to it pursuant to this Section
3.06, will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrowers, which notice shall include a certificate submitted to the Borrowers by such
Issuing Lender or such Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the
Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate any Issuing Lender
or Participant pursuant to this Section 3.06 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such
Issuing Lender or Participant notifies the Company of the change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Issuing
Lender’s or Participant’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the change giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof. The certificate required to be delivered
