through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also
been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain
locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been and may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions
comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief
that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers. In some states, there have also been regulatory and
legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales
model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores
that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.

Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict
our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change
over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial
condition and operating results.

**Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock**

**The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.**

The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some
of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $900.40 per share and a low of $70.10
per share, as adjusted to give effect to the reflect the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 (the “Stock Split”). The
stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and
may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market
price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate
degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market
price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future
stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.

**Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.**

We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we
continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding
future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing
products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators
of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be
focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.

**We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to**
**decline.**

We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting
business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been
inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to
anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and
planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could
occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.
