remaining unamortized expense of $22 million for that tranche, which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the
grant date, was accelerated into the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 billion became
probable of being achieved during the second quarter of 2020 and consequently, we recognized a catch-up expense of $79 million in that quarter.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, the second and third tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by
the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestones of $150.0 billion and $200.0 billion and the operational milestones of annualized Adjusted
EBITDA of $1.5 billion and annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion had been achieved. Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $95 million and
$118 million associated with the second and third tranches, respectively, which were previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as
determined on the grant date were accelerated into the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0
billion became probable of being achieved during the third quarter of 2020 and consequently, we recognized a catch-up expense of $77 million in that quarter.

During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the fourth tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of
Directors that the market capitalization milestone of $250.0 billion and the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 billion had been
achieved. Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $122 million for that tranche, which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future
quarters through the third quarter of 2023 as determined on the grant date, was accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth
quarter of 2020, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $8.0 billion became probable of being achieved and consequently, we recognized a
catch-up expense of $75 million in that quarter.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $264 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the operational milestones that were
considered either probable of achievement or achieved but not yet certified, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.6 years. As of
December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $712 million for the operational milestones that were considered not probable
of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $838 million, $296 million and
$175 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

**2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards**

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholdersâ€™
interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain
employees (excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 5.4 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Each award
consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance milestones, assuming
continued employment and service through each vesting date:

   - 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle;

   - 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;

   - 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and

   - 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30% for any three-year period.

As of December 31, 2020, the following performance milestones had been achieved:

   - Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;

   - Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and

   - Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020,
we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $4 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not record any additional stock-based compensation related to the 2014 Performance-Based Stock
Option Awards.
