**Automotive Asset-backed Notes**

From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows
generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’
expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in
accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs,
including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. A third party contracted with us to provide administrative and
collection services for these automotive assets.

of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of discounts and fees,

SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is
distributed to us. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets
