**Note 1 – Overview**

Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture
and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief
Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among
two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

As of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic. In 2020, we
temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and partners
also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada.
We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced operations or
closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our
new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations at all of our
manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies
on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or
close non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of such trends has
recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce. We cannot predict the duration or direction of
such trends, which have also adversely affected and may in the future affect our operations.

On February 19, 2020, we completed a public offering of our common stock and issued a total of 15.2 million shares (as adjusted to give effect to the
Stock Split, as described in the paragraph below), for total cash proceeds of $2.31 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of $28 million.

On August 10, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a five-for-one split of the Company’s common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend (the
“Stock Split”). Each stockholder of record on August 21, 2020 received a dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each then-held share,
distributed after close of trading on August 28, 2020. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact
of the Stock Split.

On September 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell $5.00 billion in shares of our common stock
from time to time through an “at-the-market” offering program. Such sales were completed by September 4, 2020 and settled by September 9, 2020, with the
sale of 11,141,562 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 billion and net proceeds of $4.97 billion, net of sales agents’ commissions of $25
million and other offering costs of $1 million.

On December 8, 2020, we entered into a separate Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell $5.00 billion in shares of our common
stock from time to time through an “at-the-market” offering program. Such sales were completed by December 9, 2020 and settled by December 11, 2020, with
the sale of 7,915,589 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 billion and net proceeds of $4.99 billion, net of sales agents’ commissions of
$13 million and other offering costs of $1 million.
