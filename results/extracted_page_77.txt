Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as
required by certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at
fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other non-current assets or other long-term liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as
other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as operating activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows. Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows (in millions):

Disclosure of Fair Values

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, MyPower customer notes receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments other than our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, our
subsidiary’s Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 and our subsidiary’s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 (collectively referred to as
“Convertible Senior Notes” below), 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025 (“2025 Notes”), solar asset-backed notes and solar loan-backed notes approximate their fair
values.

We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2025 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk
measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our solar asset-backed notes and solar
loan-backed notes based on rates currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level III). The following table presents the estimated fair
values and the carrying values (in millions):

**December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**

**Carrying Value** **Fair Value** **Carrying Value** **Fair Value**
Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,971 $ 24,596 $ 3,729 $ 6,110
2025 Notes $ 1,785 $ 1,877 $ 1,782 $ 1,748
