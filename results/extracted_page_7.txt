**Purchase Financing and Leases**

We offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia through various financial
institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject
vehicles at pre-determined values. We also offer vehicle financing arrangements in certain markets for specified vehicle models directly through our local
subsidiaries.

**Insurance**

In August 2019, we launched an insurance product designed for our customers, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives. This
product is currently available in California, and we plan to expand both the markets in which we offer insurance products and our ability to offer such products,
as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

**Energy Storage Systems**

We currently offer certain loan, lease and/or PPA options to residential or commercial customers who pair energy storage systems with solar energy
systems. We intend to introduce financial services offerings for customers who purchase standalone energy storage products in the future.

**Solar Energy Systems**

We offer various financing options to our solar customers. Our solar loan offers third-party financing to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar
energy system. We are not a party to the loan agreement, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. Our solar lease offers
customers a fixed monthly fee at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills and an electricity production guarantee. Our solar PPA charges
customers a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. We monetize the customer payments we receive
from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors. We also intend to introduce financial services offerings for our Solar Roof customers in
the future.

**Manufacturing**

**Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California**

We manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory and other local
manufacturing facilities. We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards,
such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithium-ion battery cells, at these locations.

**Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada**

We have integrated battery material, cell, module and battery pack production for Model 3, Model Y and our energy products in one location at
Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and our energy storage products there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high
volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We
continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there, including through our agreement with Panasonic.

**Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York**

We use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage
components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions.

**Gigafactory Shanghai in China**

We established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and
manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there.
Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the
learnings from our Model 3 ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production there quickly and cost-effectively.
