outstanding Letters of Credit (including all outstanding Collateralized Letters of Credit) in calculating the Aggregate Exposure and Excess
Availability at such time.

The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company and the
other Borrowers to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders that all the conditions specified in Section 6 (with respect to the
occurrence of the Effective Date and Credit Events on the Effective Date) and in this Section 7 (with respect to the occurrence of the
Effective Date and Credit Events on or after the Effective Date) and applicable to such Credit Event are satisfied as of that time, in each
case, to the extent the satisfaction of any such condition is not expressly subject to any Lender’s or Agent’s determination. All of the
Notes, certificates, legal opinions and other documents and papers referred to in Section 6 and in this Section 7, unless otherwise
specified, shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office for the account of each of the Lenders and, except for the
Notes, in sufficient counterparts or copies for each of the Lenders and shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.

the Loans, and issue (or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein, each of the Company and the other Borrowers makes the
following representations and warranties, in each case after giving effect to the Transaction, all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, with the occurrence of the
Effective Date and each Credit Event on or after the Effective Date being deemed to constitute a representation and warranty that the
matters specified in this Section 8 are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Effective Date and on the date of each such
Credit Event (it being understood and agreed that (x) any representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date
shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects only as of such specified date and (y) any representation or warranty that
is qualified by “materiality”, “Material Adverse Effect” or similar language shall be true and correct in all respects).

8.01. Company Status. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly existing
Business, (ii) has the Business power and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and
presently proposes to engage, (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing (or its equivalent, to the extent
that such concept is applicable in the respective jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualifications, except in the case of
clause (i) (other than in the case of the Company), cause (ii) and this clause (iii) for failures to be so qualified or authorized which, either
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iv) with respect to each Credit
Party incorporated in a jurisdiction where European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings of
20 May 2015 (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies and each UK Credit Party (to the extent that the Insolvency Regulation is recognized in
England and Wales after 31 December 2020), it has its centre of main interest (as that term is used in Section 3(1) of the Insolvency
Regulation) in its jurisdiction of incorporation and it has no establishment (as defined in section 2(h) of the Insolvency Regulation) in any
other jurisdiction that is a member state of the European Union.
