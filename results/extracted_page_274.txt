4.02. Voluntary Termination of Revolving Loan Commitments. (a) Upon at least three Business Days’ prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders),
the Borrowers shall have the right, subject to the requirements of Section 5.02(a), at any time or from time to time, without premium or
penalty to terminate the Total Revolving Loan Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part, pursuant to this Section 4.02(a), in an integral
multiple of $10,000,000 in the case of partial reductions to the Total Revolving Loan Commitment; provided that (i) each such reduction
shall apply proportionately to permanently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender and (ii) in the case of any partial
reduction, after giving effect to such reduction (x) the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the
Maximum Letter of Credit Amount (for this purpose, using the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of amounts denominated in Euros or any Acceptable
Foreign Currency) and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding shall not exceed the Maximum Swingline
Amount and (iii) in the case of any termination of the Total Revolving Loan Commitment in whole, the applicable Borrower or Borrowers
shall have provided cash collateral to the respective Issuing Lender or Lenders in an amount equal to 102% of the undrawn Stated Amount
of all outstanding Letters of Credit in a manner reasonably acceptable to the respective Issuing Lender. Any such notice of termination
delivered in connection with a refinancing of all or part of this Agreement or any other transaction may be, if so expressly stated to be,
conditional upon the consummation of such refinancing or other transaction and may be revoked by the Borrowers in the event such
refinancing or other transaction is not consummated.

(b) In the event of refusals by a Lender to consent to certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with
respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section 13.1213.13(b),
the Borrowers shall have the right, subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 13.1213.13(b) with the express written consent
of the Required Lenders, upon three Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to terminate the entire Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender,
so long as all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other amounts, owing to such Lender (including all amounts,
if any, owing pursuant to Section 2.11) are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination (at which time Schedule 1.01(a)
shall be deemed modified to reflect such changed amounts) and such Lender’s RL Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash
collateralized in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders for so long as such
Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding (it being understood that, for purposes of clarity, at the request of the Company, upon a
determination by the Administrative Agent or the respective Issuing Lenders that there exists cash collateral in excess of such Lender’s RL
Percentage of such Letter of Credit Exposure, such excess cash collateral may be returned to the applicable Borrowers so long as no
Default or Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom), and at such time such Lender shall no longer constitute a “Lender” for
purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to indemnifications under this Agreement (including Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.06, 5.04,
12.06, 13.01 and 13.0613.07), which shall survive as to such repaid Lender.

4.03. Mandatory Reduction of Commitments. The Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender shall terminate in its
entirety upon the Final Maturity Date applicable thereto.
