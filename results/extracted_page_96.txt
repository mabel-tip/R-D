liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have net $260 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likelythan-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have material release of valuation allowance for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors,
including the results of operations and magnitude of excess tax deductions for stock-based compensation. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation
allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the
improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deduction available in the future, we may release the
valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the
recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as
follows (in millions):

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2020** **2019** **2018**
Tax at statutory federal rate $ 242 $ (139) $ (211)
State tax, net of federal benefit 4 5 3
Nondeductible executive compensations 184 62 39
Other nondeductible expenses 52 32 26
Excess tax benefits related to stock based
compensation (666) (7) (44)
Foreign income rate differential 33 189 161
U.S. tax credits (181) (107) (80)
Noncontrolling interests and redeemable
noncontrolling interests adjustment 5 (29) 32
GILTI inclusion 133 — —
Convertible debt — (4) —
Unrecognized tax benefits 1 17 1
Change in valuation allowance 485 91 131
Provision for income taxes $ 292 $ 110 $ 58

As of December 31, 2020, we had $9.65 billion of federal and $6.60 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable
income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2031 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity
and some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be
utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

As of December 31, 2020, we had research and development tax credits of $417 million and $373 million for federal and state income tax purposes,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state of California
research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $167 million for federal
income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an
“ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.

The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25% statutory
corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through 2023.

No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings
are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.
