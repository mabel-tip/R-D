The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional
vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’ capabilities.

We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion
technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to
medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from
more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the
market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the
electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers
have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are
also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.

We also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions
and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network
capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

**Energy Storage Systems**

The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are
similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and
efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products
give us a competitive advantage in our markets.

**Solar Energy Systems**

The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We
compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar
energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install
solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and
that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.

**Intellectual** **Property**

We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As
part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks,
copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For
example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our
innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also
adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating
to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a
common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.

**Human Capital Resources**

As of December 31, 2020, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 70,757. To date, we have not experienced any work
stoppages as a result of labor disputes, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our key human capital objectives in managing our
business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
