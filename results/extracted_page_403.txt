**7.4** **Partial conversion**

The giving of a notice by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Clause 7.1 (Conversion by notice) in relation to any class of Security Assets of

**8.** **EXCLUDED ASSETS**

Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the Collateral Agent in writing, there shall be excluded from the Security created by Clause

include:

(a) any property, interest or other rights for so long as the grant of such security interest shall constitute or result in:

(i) a breach or termination pursuant to the terms of, or a default under, any General Intangible, lease,
license, contract, agreement or other document;

(ii) a breach of any law or regulation which prohibits the creation of a security interest thereunder;

(iv) materially adverse tax consequences as reasonably determined by the Company,

**other than to the extent that any such term specified in clause (i) or (ii) above is rendered ineffective pursuant to any then-applicable law**
or principles of equity and provided, however, that such security interest shall attach immediately at such time as the condition causing
such abandonment, invalidation, unenforceability breach or termination shall no longer be effective and to the extent severable, shall
attach immediately to any portion of such property or other rights that does not result in any of the consequences specified in clause (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) above;
