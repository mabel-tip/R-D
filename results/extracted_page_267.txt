(b) At any time, and from time to time, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company shall be permitted, if no
Loans are then outstanding, to provide cash collateral in respect of any or all of the then outstanding Letters of Credit (each such Letter of
Credit, a “Collateralized Letter of Credit”) in an amount equal to 102% of the Stated Amount of such Letters of Credit in a manner
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender and, solely for purposes of determining whether a
Compliance Period exists at such time, the undrawn Stated Amount of such Collateralized Letters of Credit shall be excluded from the
calculation of Letter of Credit Outstandings for purposes of calculating the Aggregate Exposure and Excess Availability at such time. At
any time that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may request that the cash collateral provided in
respect of the Collateralized Letters of Credit be released and, upon such release, such Letters of Credit will again be included in the
calculation of Letter of Credit Outstandings for all purposes of calculating the Aggregate Exposure and Excess Availability. Furthermore,
to the extent that any Borrower thereafter desires to incur Loans hereunder or have additional Letters of Credit issued hereunder (or
increase the Stated Amount of any then outstanding Letter of Credit) as permitted by Section 7.04, all Collateralized Letters of Credit will
again be included in the calculation of Letter of Credit Outstandings for all purposes of calculating the Aggregate Exposure and Excess
Availability.

3.03. Letter of Credit Requests. (a) Whenever a Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for (i) in the case of a
request for a Letter of Credit by a U.S. Borrower, for the joint and several account of the U.S. Borrowers, and (ii) in the case of a request
for a Letter of Credit by a Dutch Borrower, for the joint and several account of the Dutch Borrowers and (iii) in the case of a request for a
Letter of Credit by a UK Borrower, for the joint and several account of the UK Borrowers, such Borrower shall give the respective Issuing
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days’ (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such Issuing
Lender) written notice thereof (including by way of facsimile or electronic mail). Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C,
appropriately completed (each, a “Letter of Credit Request”), and shall be accompanied by the respective Issuing Lender’s customary
application and documentation, if any, to the extent required by such Issuing Lender.

(b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by such requesting
Borrower to the Lenders that such Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section
3.02 or 3.03. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent, any Borrower, any other Credit
Party or the Required Lenders before it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in Section 6 or 7 are not then
satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 3.02 or 3.03, then such Issuing Lender shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower in accordance with such
Issuing Lender’s usual and customary practices. Upon the issuance of or modification or amendment to any standby Letter of Credit, each
Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower to be named as account party therein and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such
issuance, modification or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit or the respective
modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be. Promptly after receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Participants, in writing, of such issuance, modification or amendment. On the first Business Day of each week, each Issuing Lender shall
furnish the Administrative Agent with a written (including via facsimile) report of the daily aggregate outstandings of trade Letters of
Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for the immediately preceding week.
