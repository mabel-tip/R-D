provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to issue trade Letters of Credit if such Issuing Lender has provided the
Company notice that it is unable to issue trade Letters of Credit; provided further that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to
issue any Letter of Credit of the types described above if at the time of such issuance:

(i) (x) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to
enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law applicable to such Issuing
Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit
generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit
any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not
in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender on the date hereof, (y) the issuance of such Letter of Credit shall contradict any
internal policy of such Issuing Lender, or (z) any unreimbursed loss,
