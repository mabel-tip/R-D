case of a prepayment of Swingline Loans) and (B) at least three Business Days’ prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay LIBOR Loans, which notice (in each case) shall specify whether Revolving Loans or Swingline
Loans shall be prepaid, the amount of such prepayment and the Types of Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the specific
Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such LIBOR Loans were made, and which notice the Administrative Agent shall, except in the
case of a prepayment of Swingline Loans, promptly transmit to each of the Lenders; (ii) (x) each partial prepayment of Revolving Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.01(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $250,000 (or the U.S. Dollar Equivalent thereof in the

principal amount of at least $100,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent in any given case); provided that
if any partial prepayment of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to any Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of LIBOR Loans
made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, then such Borrowing may
not be continued as a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans (and same shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and any

transaction may be, if so expressly stated to be, conditional upon the consummation of such refinancing or other transaction and may be
revoked by the Borrowers in the event such refinancing or other transaction is not consummated.

with such repayment pursuant to Section 4.02(b) (at which time Schedule 1.01(a) shall be deemed modified to reflect the changed
Revolving Loan Commitments) and (B) such Lender’s RL Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash collateralized in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is
outstanding (it being understood that, for purposes of clarity, at the request of the Company, upon a determination by the Administrative
