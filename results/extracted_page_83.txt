transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our
common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the
convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase
the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting
criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in
connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance
sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2022 Notes on at
least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2022 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2022 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified $115 million
of the carrying value of the 2022 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $5 million, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal
of our 2022 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes would be in cash, shares of our common stock or a
combination thereof is at our election, the remaining liability is classified as non-current. The debt discounts recorded on the 2022 Notes are recognized as
interest expense through March 2022 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through December 31, 2020, including the
losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $474 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes were converted for $474 million in cash and
6.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $5
million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the
2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 6.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle
under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding
principal amount by $4.92 billion.

**2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions**

In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after
deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is convertible into 16.1380 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $61.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at
their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following
circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of
our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of
immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period
after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is
less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate
events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental
change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase
price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we
would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2024
Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $491 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an
effective interest rate of 8.68%.
