Borrower, each Subsidiary Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender (if the consent of the
Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender is required pursuant to Section 2.14(a)(ii)) and each such Lender or other Eligible Transferee
which agrees to provide an Incremental Commitment (each, an “Incremental Lender”) shall execute and deliver to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent an Incremental Commitment Agreement, appropriately completed (with the effectiveness of the Incremental
Commitment provided therein to occur on the date set forth in such Incremental Commitment Agreement, which date in any event shall be
no earlier than the date on which (i) all fees required to be paid in connection therewith at the time of such effectiveness shall have been
paid, (ii) all Incremental Commitment Requirements have been satisfied, (iii) all conditions set forth in this Section 2.14 shall have been
satisfied and (iv) all other conditions precedent that may be set forth in such Incremental Commitment Agreement shall have been
satisfied) and (II) the Company, each other Borrower, each Subsidiary Guarantor, the Collateral Agent and each Incremental Lender (as
applicable) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent such additional Security Documents and/or
amendments to the Security Documents which are necessary to ensure that all Loans incurred pursuant to the Incremental Commitments
are secured by each relevant Security Document (the “Incremental Security Documents”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Commitment Agreement and, at such time, Schedule 1.01(a) shall be deemed
modified to reflect the Incremental Commitments of such Incremental Lenders.

(c) It is understood and agreed that the Incremental Commitments provided by an Incremental Lender or Incremental
Lenders, as the case may be, pursuant to each Incremental Commitment Agreement shall constitute part of, and be added to, the Total
Revolving Loan Commitment and each Incremental Lender shall constitute a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement and each other
applicable Credit Document.

(d) At the time of any provision of Incremental Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14, each Borrower shall, in
coordination with the Administrative Agent, repay outstanding Revolving Loans of certain of the Lenders, and incur additional Revolving
Loans from certain other Lenders (including the Incremental Lenders), in each case to the extent necessary so that all of the Lenders
participate in each outstanding Borrowing of Revolving Loans pro rata on the basis of their respective Revolving Loan Commitments (after
giving effect to any increase in the Total Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.14) and with the Borrowers being
obligated to pay to the respective Lenders any costs of the type referred to in Section 2.11 in connection with any such repayment and/or
Borrowing.

(e) At the time of any provision of Incremental Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14, all dollar thresholds included
in any determination made with respect to Excess Availability and the dollar amount of the Liquidity Threshold shall be increased
automatically in an amount equal to the percentage by which the Incremental Commitments increase the Total Revolving Loan
Commitment; provided that the foregoing clause (e) shall not apply (including in respect of any Incremental Commitments incurred prior
to the First Amendment Effective Date) to the dollar thresholds set forth in the definition of “Convertible Notes Maturity Default”..

2.15. Defaulting Lenders. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or in the other Credit Documents to the
contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender and if any Swingline Loan Exposure or Letter of Credit Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
