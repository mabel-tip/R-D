amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease
accounting standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03 to provide
additional guidance on the credit losses standard. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2020. The
ASUs did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-13 applies to all financial assets including loans, trade receivables
and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact
except on MyPower customer notes receivable. Refer to MyPower Customer Notes Receivable above for further details.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by
removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to
the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. We adopted
the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that
Is a Service Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with
the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internaluse software license). We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

**Note 3 – Business Combinations**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed various acquisitions for which consideration was immaterial on an individual basis and in
aggregate.

**Maxwell Acquisition**

On May 16, 2019 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed our strategic acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (“Maxwell”), an energy storage and
power delivery products company, for its complementary technology and workforce. Pursuant to the related Agreement and Plan of Merger, each issued and
outstanding share of Maxwell common stock was converted into 0.0965 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the
Stock Split. In addition, Maxwell’s stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in
respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately
prior to the acquisition.

Fair Value of Purchase Consideration

The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was $207 million (as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, 4,514,840 shares issued at
$45.90 per share, the opening price of our common stock on the Acquisition Date).

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total
purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition
Date.

Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the
expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Significant inputs used for the model
included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates.
