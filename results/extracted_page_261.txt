of the Dutch General Security Agreement, Section 5.3 of the Dutch Inventory Security Agreement or Section 6.3 of the Dutch Receivables
Security Agreement or Section 17.1 of the UK Security Agreement, any amount payable to a Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on
account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 13.02) may, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a
segregated non-interest bearing account and, subject to any requirements of applicable law, be applied at such time or times as may be
determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lenders or the
Swingline Lender hereunder, (iii) third, to the funding of any Loan or the funding or cash collateralization of any participation in any
Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (iv) fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent, held in such account as
cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender under this Agreement, (v) fifth, to the payment of any amounts
owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (vi) sixth, so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and (vii) seventh, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is (x) a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans or repayments of Unpaid Drawings in
respect of which a Defaulting Lender has funded its participation obligations and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 7 are satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all
Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or Unpaid Drawings owed to, any Defaulting
Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts
owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this clause (c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(d) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender each agrees
that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then (i) the Swingline
Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Revolving Loan
Commitments and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline
Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance
with its RL Percentage and (ii) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, all funds held as cash collateral pursuant to the Letter
of Credit Back-Stop Arrangements shall thereafter be promptly returned to the applicable Borrowers; provided that, except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed to by the affected parties and subject to Section 9.1513.25, no change hereunder from a Defaulting Lender to
a Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against such Defaulting Lender arising
from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. If the Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated, all Obligations have been
paid in full and no Letters of Credit are outstanding, then all funds held as cash collateral pursuant to the Letter of Credit Back-Stop
Arrangements shall thereafter be promptly returned to the applicable Borrowers.
