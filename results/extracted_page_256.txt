maturity date, as applicable, with respect thereto; (c) if any prepayment of any of its LIBOR Loans by the applicable Borrower is not made
on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the respective Borrower or Borrowers; or (d) as a consequence of (i) any other
default by the respective Borrower or Borrowers to repay LIBOR Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by
such Lender or (ii) any election made pursuant to Section 2.10(bc).

2.12. Lending Offices and Affiliate Lenders for Loans in Available Currency.

(a) Each Lender may at any time or from time to time designate, by written notice to the Administrative Agent to the
extent not already reflected on Schedule 13.03, one or more lending offices (which, for this purpose, may include Affiliates of the
respective Lender) for the various Loans in the Available Currency made, and Letters of Credit participated in, by such Lender (including
by designating a separate lending office (or Affiliate) to act as such with respect to such Loans and Letter of Credit Outstandings);
provided that, for designations made after the Effective Date, to the extent such designation shall result in increased costs or taxes under
Section 2.10, 3.06 or 5.04 in excess of those which would be charged in the absence of the designation of a different lending office
(including a different Affiliate of the respective Lender), then the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay such excess increased costs or
taxes (although if such designation results in increased costs or taxes, the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the costs and taxes which
would have applied in the absence of such designation and any subsequent increased costs and taxes of the type described above resulting
from changes after the date of the respective designation). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, each lending office
and Affiliate of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, be
treated in the same manner as the respective designating Lender (and shall be entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect
of its acting as such hereunder).

(b) Each Lender agrees that on the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii),
Section 2.10(cd), Section 3.06 or Section 5.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts
(subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by
such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or
regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in
this Section 2.12(b) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 2.10,
3.06 and 5.04.

2.13. Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or an Impacted Lender, (b) upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 2.10(cd), Section 3.06 or Section 5.04 with
respect to any Lender which results in such Lender requesting additional amounts from the Borrowers pursuant to any such Sections, (c)
in the case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this Agreement
which has been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section 13.1213.13(b) or (d) in the circumstances
provided in Section 2.19(b), the Borrowers shall have the right, in accordance with Section 13.0413.05(b), to replace such Lender (the
“Replaced Lender”) with one or more other Eligible Transferees (collectively, the “Replacement Lender”) and each of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender; provided that:
