energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which also incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with
Powerwall.

**Design and Engineering**

**Automotive**

We have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team
has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new
models. Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance, cost and durability in
ways that are best suited for our vehicles’ target demographics and utility. We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping,
casting and thermal systems, and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs
to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.

We are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while exploring ways to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets,
including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of
automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.

**Energy Generation and Storage**

Our expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products
and components. We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems
and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and maximizes the
energy production of each solar energy system, as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation.

**Sales and Marketing**

Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such
media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at
relatively low marketing costs.

**Automotive**

**Direct Sales**

Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have
galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure
enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the
Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.

We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels. Sales of
vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.

**Used Vehicle Sales**

Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a
new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.
We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.

**Public Charging**

We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate
Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along welltraveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient,
minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs.
