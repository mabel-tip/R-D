(1) There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities
and financing funds, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified
receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in
financing funds or various other assets and as may be further described below.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries.
The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts or
deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2020, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum liquidity and
expense-coverage balances and ratios.

**2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions**

In March 2014, we issued $1.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Notes in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional
$180 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options by the underwriters. The total net proceeds
from the issuances, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.36 billion.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of these notes is now convertible into 13.8940 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $71.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes have been able to
elect to convert on or after December 1, 2020. The settlement of such an election to convert the outstanding notes would be in cash for the principal amount
and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election. As of December 1, 2020, holders of these notes have the
option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert prior to December 1, 2020 under the circumstances further described below.   Upon the early
conversion of the 2021 Notes, we will pay cash for the principal amount and deliver shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value. If a
fundamental change occurs prior to the applicable maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the
applicable maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such an event in certain
circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these
notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $369 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an
effective interest rate of 5.96%.
