all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such excess, the “Aggregate
Excess Amount”), each such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who has made payments in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor’s
Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all Guarantors in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations (the aggregate amount of such deficit, the “Aggregate Deficit Amount”) in an amount equal to (x) a fraction
the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of such Guarantor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount
of all Guarantors multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Deficit Amount of such other Guarantor. A Guarantor’s right of contribution pursuant to
the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each computation, subject to adjustment to the time of each computation; provided that
no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until the Termination Date, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties
hereto that any Guarantor’s right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 18 against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior
and subordinate to such other Guarantor’s obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations
owing under this Guaranty. As used in this Section 18: (i) each Guarantor’s “Contribution Percentage” shall mean the percentage obtained
by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor by (y) the aggregate Adjusted Net Worth of all Guarantors; (ii)
the “Adjusted Net Worth” of each Guarantor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor and (y) zero;
and (iii) the “Net Worth” of each Guarantor shall mean the amount by which the fair saleable value of such Guarantor’s assets on the date
of any Relevant Payment exceeds its existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but without giving effect to any
Guaranteed Obligations arising under this Guaranty or any guaranteed obligations arising under any guaranty of any Permitted Additional
Indebtedness) on such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, any Guarantor that is released from this Guaranty
pursuant to Section 17 hereof shall thereafter have no contribution obligations, or rights, pursuant to this Section 18, and at the time of any
such release, if the released Guarantor had an Aggregate Excess Amount or an Aggregate Deficit Amount, same shall be deemed reduced
to $0, and the contribution rights and obligations of the remaining Guarantors shall be recalculated on the respective date of release (as
otherwise provided above) based on the payments made hereunder by the remaining Guarantors. All parties hereto recognize and agree
that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 18, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment until
the Termination Date. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall
constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its
contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain solvent, in the
determination of the Required Lenders.

19. LIMITATION ON GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. Each Guarantor and each Secured Creditor (by its
acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty) hereby confirms that it is its intention that this Guaranty not constitute a fraudulent transfer
or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of any similar Federal or state law. To
effectuate the foregoing intention, each Guarantor and each Secured Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty) hereby
irrevocably agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed by such Guarantor shall be limited to such amount as will, after giving
effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws and
after giving effect to any rights to
