refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal
year 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2020.

**Overview and 2020 Highlights**

Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric
vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related
to our products.

In 2020, we produced 509,737 vehicles and delivered 499,647 vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity,
developing and ramping our battery cell technology, increasing the affordability of our vehicles, expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next
vehicles.

In 2020, we deployed 3.02 GWh of energy storage products and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping
production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy
systems.

In 2020, we recognized total revenues of $31.54 billion, representing an increase of $6.96 billion compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp
production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue
growth.

In 2020, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $721 million, representing a favorable change of $1.58 billion compared to the prior
year. In 2020, our operating margin was 6.3%, representing a favorable change of 6.6% compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on operational
efficiencies, while we have seen an acceleration of non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to a rapid increase in our market capitalization and updates
to our business outlook.

We ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents, representing an increase of $13.12 billion from the end of 2019. Our cash flows from
operating activities during 2020 was $5.94 billion, compared to $2.41 billion during 2019, and capital expenditures amounted to $3.16 billion during 2020,
compared to $1.33 billion during 2019. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, but we will continue a number of capital-intensive
projects in upcoming periods.

**Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2021 Outlook**

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

There continues to be worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date, we
have previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments, and impediments to administrative activities
supporting our product deliveries and deployments. There are also ongoing related risks to our business depending on the progression of the pandemic, and
recent trends in certain regions have indicated potential returns to limited or closed government functions, business activities and person-to-person
interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries. For example, pandemic-related issues have
exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly,
increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply, and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted. Please see the “Results
of Operations” section of this Item below and certain risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly the
first risk factor included there, for more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our business.

We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends from this pandemic, the sustained impact of which is largely unknown, is rapidly
evolving and has varied across geographic regions. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve
our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and
other resources accordingly.
